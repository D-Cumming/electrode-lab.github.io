We seek a highly motivated and collaborative postdoctoral scholar to join an interdisciplinary research program on decision-making deficits in Alzheimerâ€™s disease, in frontotemporal dementia, and in preclinical carriers of autosomal dominant mutations for familial frontotemporal dementia. This program is directed by [Winston Chiong, MD PhD]({{ '/team/index.html#Winston Chiong' | prepend: site.baseurl | prepend: site.url }}) in the University of California, San Francisco Memory and Aging Center; in conjunction with [Ming Hsu, PhD](http://neuroecon.berkeley.edu/){:target="_blank"} (UC Berkeley Haas School of Business), [Andrew Kayser, MD PhD](http://kayserlab.ucsf.edu/){:target="_blank"} (UCSF Neurology), [Scott Kim, MD PhD](http://mainsite.scottkimbioethics.org/){:target="_blank"} (NIH), and [Katherine Rankin, PhD](https://rankinlab.ucsf.edu/){:target="_blank"} (UCSF Memory and Aging Center).


The postdoctoral fellow will design and conduct task-based functional MRI, structural MRI, and behavioral studies of patients with mild dementia, preclinical mutation carriers, noncarrier family members, and healthy older control participants. This work is informed by clinical problems that arise in the care of older adults, and is designed for dissemination to ethics/policy as well as neuroscientific audiences. The fellow will be encouraged to take advantage of other training and learning opportunities within the UCSF Weill Institute for Neurosciences &#124; Memory and Aging Center, the UC Berkeley/UCSF Center for Neural Engineering & Prostheses, and the UCSF/UC Hastings Consortium on Law, Science & Health Policy. The fellow will contribute to ongoing experiments and pursue self-directed projects in decision neuroscience of aging.
