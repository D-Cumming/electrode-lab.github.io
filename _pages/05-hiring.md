  <div class="project-title" style="color: #ffffff">Postdoc in decision neuroscience of dementia & aging</div>
</div>

We seek a highly motivated and collaborative postdoctoral scholar to join an interdisciplinary research program on decision-making deficits in Alzheimer’s disease, in frontotemporal dementia, and in preclinical carriers of autosomal dominant mutations for familial frontotemporal dementia. This program is directed by [Winston Chiong, MD PhD]({{ '/team/index.html#Winston-Chiong' | prepend: site.baseurl | prepend: site.url }}) in the University of California, San Francisco Memory and Aging Center; in conjunction with [Ming Hsu, PhD](http://neuroecon.berkeley.edu/){:target="_blank"} (UC Berkeley Haas School of Business), [Andrew Kayser, MD PhD](http://kayserlab.ucsf.edu/){:target="_blank"} (UCSF Neurology), [Scott Kim, MD PhD](http://mainsite.scottkimbioethics.org/){:target="_blank"} (NIH), and [Katherine Rankin, PhD](https://rankinlab.ucsf.edu/){:target="_blank"} (UCSF Memory and Aging Center).


The postdoctoral fellow will design and conduct task-based functional MRI, structural MRI, and behavioral studies of patients with mild dementia, preclinical mutation carriers, noncarrier family members, and healthy older control participants. This work is informed by clinical problems that arise in the care of older adults, and is designed for dissemination to ethics/policy as well as neuroscientific audiences. The fellow will be encouraged to take advantage of other training and learning opportunities within the UCSF Weill Institute for Neurosciences &#124; Memory and Aging Center, the UC Berkeley/UCSF Center for Neural Engineering & Prostheses, and the UCSF/UC Hastings Consortium on Law, Science & Health Policy. The fellow will contribute to ongoing experiments and pursue self-directed projects in decision neuroscience of aging.

### Required qualifications
- Doctoral degree or equivalent in psychology, neuroscience, or related fields
- Strong computational skills, including scripting or programming
- Previous experience in neuroimaging and/or studies of decision-making

### Preferred qualifications
- Career interest in aging or neurodegenerative disease
- Facility with GitHub, Matlab, JavaScript, and/or Visual Basic
- Two-year commitment (with opportunities to extend as mutually desired)

### How to apply
Please e-mail Ali Zahir at *ali.zahir (at) ucsf.edu* with your CV, cover letter, and names and contact information for three references. Informal inquiries are welcome. Applications will be reviewed on an ongoing basis until the position is filled.

- Excellent verbal and written communications and presentation skills; excellent organizational skills; and excellent interpersonal skills to work effectively in a diverse team
- Comfort in learning new computer programs
- Excellent analytical and problem-solving skills
- Ability to work effectively in a fast-paced, team-based environment; project management and coordination skills; ability to prioritize tasks and meet multiple deadlines on concurrent projects
- Ability to establish cooperative working relationships with research participants, co-workers, & physicians
- Self-motivated with the ability to prioritize multiple projects and meet deadlines
- Proven ability to work independently and keen attention to detail

### Preferred qualifications
