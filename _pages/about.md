The Decision Lab is headed by [Winston Chiong, MD PhD]({{ '/team/index.html#Winston Chiong' | prepend: site.baseurl | prepend: site.url }}), and is part of the [Memory and Aging Center](http://memory.ucsf.edu){:target="\_blank"} in the [UCSF Weill Institute for Neurosciences](http://weill.ucsf.edu){:target="\_blank"}. Our interdisciplinary research is informed by clinical neurology, cognitive neuroscience, the social sciences, philosophy and law, with two main themes:

1. **Decision Neuroscience in Aging and Disorders of Aging**

   We study the neural bases of decision-making in the aging brain in both health and disease, using techniques such as task-based functional MRI, online population-based methods, and computational behavioral modeling. We hope to understand brain changes underlying vulnerability to financial fraud and other mistakes, in order to inform future strategies to prevent these risks.

2. **Ethical and Policy Implications of Alterations to Brain Function**

   We also use conceptual and empirical/ethnographic methods to investigate the broader effects of brain diseases and of interventions (pharmacological and technological) that influence brain function. As the brain is the physical basis for our experiences, personalities and choices, we are particularly interested in how changes to the brain affect patients' senses of themselves and of their autonomy in decision-making.
