<h1><span class="header-section-number">Chapter 8</span> Reliability and Open Science</h1>
<p>Sadly, it has become clear that many published scientific studies fail to
replicate–that is, other scientists are unable to produce the same results,
such that reported findings cannot be relied upon by others (and, therefore,
that these “findings” do not represent a genuine contribution to human
knowledge). While this problem partly reflects inherent challenges in
scientific discovery, repeated and pervasive failures of reproducibility call
the value of science into question (see
<a href="01-organizing-principles.md">Section 1: Organizing Principles</a>). Lack of
reproducibility has many sources, which we should understand so as to minimize
their influence in our work (and also to avoid being misled when reading papers
by other labs):
1. <strong>Dependence on unreliable methods.</strong> This includes “p-hacking” (abuse of
excessive researcher degrees of freedom in study methods)
“HARKing” (hypothesizing after results are known), and widespread
misunderstandings of statistical approaches appropriate to exploratory as
opposed to confirmatory analyses; also, use of underpowered study designs and
related confusions about the difference between power and positive predictive
value. For more backfground see Simmons, Nelson &amp; Simonsohn 2011, Button et al
2013, and Ioannidis 2005 in the Resources-methods-and-reliability folder
of the R: drive.
2. <strong>Human error.</strong> Every time someone touches or manipulates a dataset, this
intoduces the possibility of unintended errors. We expect human beings to make
errors, so we have to be vigilant about checking our own work and asking other
members of our team to help check our work. This means that we have to use
methods that make it possible to identify and diagnose errors, such as by
tracking and logging transformations of data. This is one reason that we
strongly prefer that manipulations be performed in code, rather than manually in
programs like Excel (see again “Deprecated/discouraged tools” in
<a href="03-lab-resources-overview.md#deprecateddiscouraged-tools">Section 3: Lab Resources Overview</a>).
We also always want to preserve and archive our raw, unmanipulated datasets so
that we can always start over if absolutely necessary.
3. <strong>“Bad” luck.</strong> Suppose that 20 different research teams are investigating
the same false hypothesis. Even if the null hypothesis holds (there is no true
finding), given a conventional significance value of 0.05 it is likely that one
of these teams will reach a statistically significant result by chance. Given a
publishing bias for positive over negative studies (see point 4 below), this
false finding is likely to be published while the 19 correct, negative studies
would be ignored. This is often a hollow accomplishment, as labs tend to base
future studies on previous findings, so publishing a paper based on a false
chance finding can lead to years of wasted work pursuing scientific dead ends.
4. <strong>Perverse incentives in science.</strong> Researchers face tremendous career
pressures to publish in order to keep their jobs or secure funding, and
publishers generally favor positive over negative results and “surprising”
findings over those that follow more directly from what is already known. All of
these incentives promote the production and dissemination of false positive
findings.</p>
<p>Finally, there’s one more sense of “reproducibility” that is important for the
organization of our lab. As emphasized earlier, most members of the lab only
stay for 2-3 years, so much of the work you’re doing now will be completed by
future members. You should try to document your work in a way that it will be
intelligible to future lab members, who can then pick up your work without
needing to rebuild your analyses from scratch.</p>
<div id="approaches-to-promote-reliability" class="section level2">
<h2><span class="header-section-number">8.1</span> Approaches to promote reliability</h2>
<p>There are some broad principles and practices that we use in the lab to promote
the reliability of our work, that everyone (particularly those engaged in
quantitative research) should understand:
1. <strong>Distinguishing exploratory vs. hypothesis-driven design.</strong> One of the
major problems in quantitative research is that many scientists’ aims are in fact
exploratory (e.g., trying to look for new things and elucidate processes that
haven’t yet been discovered), but our accepted statistical thresholds for
publication (e.g., p values and confidence intervals) implicitly assume
confirmatory (hypothesis-driven) methods. So many scientists, often without
really understanding the statistical issues involved, report exploratory work
as if it were hypothesis-driven (e.g., reporting on p values) even though the
hypotheses being tested were not actually formulated prior to looking at the
data. This violates the assumptions of significance testing and so often
contributes to false positive reports. Unfortunately, how to properly report
exploratory
research remains an open question that the scientific community is still working
out. Still, we should remain careful in our thinking about when our aims are
exploratory and when they’re hypothesis-driven, and we should not try to pass
off exploratory work as hypothesis-driven.
2. <strong>Study pre-registration when feasible; in all cases, pre-planning.</strong> In
general, if we are conducting a hypothesis-driven study, it makes good sense to
pre-register our study design. Generally we use the
<a href="http://osf.io">Open Science Framework</a>.
Pre-registration has been standard practice in randomized controlled trials for
many years, and is now being extended to other kinds of experimental research.
Even when we are not pre-registering studies or we are planning purely
exploratory work, it is generally a useful exercise to think
in advance about what questions we are interested in, and what would be the best
approaches to answer these questions, before we start poking around in datasets.
Hopefully this can help us avoid treating noise in our dataset as signal.
3. <strong>Documentation.</strong> This is something I struggle with, but is crucially
important for other members of the lab and also for yourself. It’s natural to
assume, when you’re totally cognitive engaged in a problem, that it will be very
easy for you to recall later what you did and why. In fact we all tend to
overestimate our recall for these details, once we move on to solve new
problems. It’s really important to use our electronic lab notebooks in the
private Github repo to document our thought processes. (This will help you in
the future as well.) This is particularly crucial for recording a paper trail of
analytic decisions, data cleaning, and other decisions affecting findings (e.g.,
leaving out outliers and why).
4. <strong>“Literate programming.”</strong> This refers to a different way of thinking about
work that we do in code. As expressed by the computer scientist Donald Knuth:</p>
<pre><code>&gt; &quot;Let us change our traditional attitude to the construction of programs. Instead </code></pre>
<p>of imagining that our main task is to instruct a computer what to do, let us
concentrate rather on explaining to humans what we want the computer to do."</p>
<ul>
<li>In other words, think of your code (whether in R, Stata, Matlab, or any other
language) as like an essay intended to communicate to other human beings.
This should follow the order and logic of human
thought, and not just the forms imposed by the computer. It is not only
important that the code “works” (in that it makes the computer perform the
operations that you intend); it’s also important that people who read
your scripts (including your future self) can understand the flow of your
thinking and what each piece of code is intended to do.
<a href="09-rstudio-analysis-pathway.md">Section 9: RStudio Analysis Pathway</a> provides a
detailed tutorial to one implementation of literate programming.</li>
</ul>
<ol start="5" style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li><strong>Coming soon: code review.</strong> As above, human error is common and expected.
We should all be diligent about checking our own work, but in most cases we also
need other people to help us find errors that we can’t find ourselves. Software
developers don’t rely solely on individual programmers to find errors in their
code, but instead use collaborative tools so that teams can check one another.
This is one of the reasons why all of our code is intended to be shared in the
Github repository, rather than just being distributed across different people’s
desktop computers. In the coming year, I’m hoping to start using collaborative
tools in Github that facilitate review of our code by other lab members. This is
another reason why it’s important to write “literate code” that can be readily
understood by others, and not just a series of computational operations.</li>
<li><strong>Also coming soon: publishing our code.</strong> Increasingly, it will be an
expectation that when someone publishes a scientific study, that they also
make their datasets and code publicly accessible so that other scientists can
check their work. After all, if you’re not confident enough in your code to
allow other scientists to review it, then should you be confident enough to
publish findings based on this code? If you’re reading a study but the authors
are not willing to publish their code, should you believe what they report? We
will start producing our code in a manner that facilitates such sharing, as
described further in
<a href="09-rstudio-analysis-pathway.md">Section 9: RStudio Analysis Pathway</a>.</li>
</ol>
</div>
<div id="open-science" class="section level2">
<h2><span class="header-section-number">8.2</span> Open science</h2>
<p>The term “open science” is used in many different ways by different scientists,
but in general the ideas above follow many of the broad principles of open
science. We want to produce work that can be relied upon, used, and extended by
other scientists. When feasible, we will pre-register studies, particularly for
hypothesis-driven work. We will also aim to post our code when we publish our
studies, in part to encourage ourselves to check our code carefully. When permitted by
publishers’ policies, we will post free versions of our papers on our lab
website so that scholars everywhere can read them.</p>
<p>One respect in which our science may not be fully open has to do with the
openness of our datasets. Much of our work involves stigmatized disorders such
as dementia, or potentially sensitive topics such as money management or
vulnerability to financial errors in aging. For published studies, we should
review the consent forms for particular studies as well as MAC data sharing
policies to see what forms of data sharing are consistent with center policies
and participants’ reasonable expectations regarding the privacy of potentially
sensitive data. When feasible and ethically permissible, we should aim to share
our datasets (potentially also in redacted form).</p>
