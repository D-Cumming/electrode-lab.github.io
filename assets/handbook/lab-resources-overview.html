<h1><span class="header-section-number">Chapter 3</span> Lab Resources Overview</h1>
<p>Here is a very general overview of lab-wide resources that everyone in both
sides of the lab should be familiar with. (Some projects
also use specific tools that should be separately documented.) As one broad
principle to keep in mind: research coordinators in the lab
typically stay 2-3 years, but many of our projects span a much longer period of
time. We need everyone to perform protocols consistently,
and to document their work carefully, so that the people who follow you can
continue your work.</p>
<div id="slack" class="section level2">
<h2><span class="header-section-number">3.1</span> <a href="http://ucsfdecisionlab.slack.com">Slack</a></h2>
<p>Slack is the primary method of communication within the lab. You can customize
your notification preferences (particularly important on the mobile app) so you
are notified of important messages but also are not overwhelmed. Use the ‘@’
feature to get my attention if I need to get involved in a conversation, and
make sure that you’re subscribed to the right channels (#general and #random for
everyone, and as of this writing #agingcog, #code, #diversity, #dma, #gbd, and
#neurotech depending on role/interests).</p>
<p>Two important caveats about Slack:
1. Slack is not considered secure or HIPAA-compliant. No PHI (protected health
information) belongs there, and in general any discussion involving individual
research participants should be conducted via SECURE: e-mail rather than Slack.
2. Slack is not an archive. Our free lab account only allows us to view the last
10,000 messages, and to store 5gb of files–everything older than that
disappears. So we use Slack for rapid, concurrent conversation–but anything that
we might want
to refer to later needs to be documented, most likely in GitHub.</p>
</div>
<div id="lab-website" class="section level2">
<h2><span class="header-section-number">3.2</span> <a href="https://decisionlab.ucsf.edu">Lab website</a></h2>
<p>Our lab website is where we communicate what we do and share our work with the
outside world. This is hosted on our public GitHub repository, which you will
need a GitHub account to edit. See the README at
<a href="https://github.com/DecisionLabUCSF/decisionlabucsf.github.io" class="uri">https://github.com/DecisionLabUCSF/decisionlabucsf.github.io</a> to learn how to add
your team profile. Because this is a public repository, anyone can read the code
that we use to build the website, and it also has an open license inviting other
investigators to use this code to design their own websites if they wish. (Kate
Rankin’s lab is building a new website based on our website’s code…)</p>
<p>As I say in the README, you can think of GitHub as like a supercharged Google
Docs for code, allowing multiple people to work on code together, keeping track
of who made what changes and when, making it easy to reverse changes that have
been made, and allowing different versions to be developed at the same time.
Tools like this are commonly used by software companies to maintain quality and
avoid/fix bugs. We won’t be using all of the sophisticated tools in GitHub that
they use, but generally I think scientists have a lot to learn from software
developers: Facebook and Google can’t survive with sloppy code and neither can we.</p>
</div>
<div id="private-github-repo" class="section level2">
<h2><span class="header-section-number">3.3</span> <a href="https://github.com/UCSFMemoryAndAging/decisionlab">Private Github repo</a></h2>
<p>In addition to our public repository, we also have a private repository that
only lab members can view, which is where we document and edit our code, and
maintain
electronic lab notebooks. See the README at
<a href="https://github.com/UCSFMemoryAndAging/decisionlab" class="uri">https://github.com/UCSFMemoryAndAging/decisionlab</a> for details once your account
is fully set up with permissions. A basic way of working with GitHub is just
editing files on the GitHub website. However, to use GitHub for code that can be
utilized by statistical/analytic packages like R and MATLAB, you will need to
synchronize the lab repo to a folder on your computer (like a more technical
version of Dropbox or Box). For more details on how to do this, see Chapter 9 of
this lab handbook,
<a href="09-rstudio-analysis-pathway.md">RStudio analysis pathway</a>.</p>
<p>Here are some key initial points:
1. As with Slack, no protected data. PIDNs and other assigned identifiers can
pop up infrequently, but we should avoid other participant-level data, and
especially PHI and participant identifiers (names, dates of birth, addresses,
demographics, etc.)
2. GitHub works best with text-editable files: code, markdown files, HTML,
notebooks and the like. GitHub is much less useful for big files like images,
Word and Powerpoint files, and they tend to clog things up for everyone else who
is syncing to the repo. Images should be reduced in size whenever possible, and
Microsoft Office files (Word, Powerpoint) should stay out of GitHub and go on
the R: drive somewhere.
3. Please be consistent about naming and file organization, and be obsessive
about documentation and comments! Again, other people will pick your work up
after you, so please be kind to them in advance.
4. Try to keep line length to about 80 characters, and commit-pull-push!</p>
</div>
<div id="r-drive-r" class="section level2">
<h2><span class="header-section-number">3.4</span> R: drive (R:)</h2>
<p>To recap some points from above: Slack can’t be used for protected data or
discussion of individual research participants, and isn’t an archive. GitHub is
an archive for code and documentation, but also shouldn’t be used for protected
data or identifiers (and documentation about individual participants should be
limited), and shouldn’t be used for large files such as Microsoft Office
documents. So: we use the R: drive for large datasets, especially those
including personal identifiers, and other useful resources that are too large to
put in GitHub. (Quick personal note: I’m often working from my laptop and home
computer, on which I only mount the R: drive intermittently–so if you need me
to look at something, it will often be a lot faster if it lives in GitHub or is
temporarily available in Slack.) For instructions on how to mount the R: drive
on your computer, see the Technology section of <a href="https://wiki.library.ucsf.edu/display/MACipedia/MACipedia+Home">MACipedia</a>.</p>
<p>For using statistical packages, a model for how to utilize the R: drive with the
GitHub repo is described in
<a href="09-rstudio-analysis-pathway.md">Section 9: RStudio Analysis Pathway</a>. As a
general overview, the pathway is:
1. Clone the decisionlab GitHub repo to your computer.
2. Save original dataset (e.g., a .csv or Excel file from Qualtrics or E-Prime)
on the R: drive, and never write to this file again.
3. Clean the data, using a script and a logging file that are saved in GitHub,
creating a cleaned data file that is saved back on the R: drive.
4. Analyze the data using other script and logging files that are saved in
GitHub, generating new data files and graphics as necessary that are saved on
the R: drive.</p>
<p>Since everyone is using the R: drive for a variety of projects (which will
continue on after you leave), keeping our group folder organized is a challenge!
Please refer to Guide.docx on the R: drive which explains how the subfolders are
organized. The subfolder R:includes a number of files that I
hope you find useful, including the subfolder “Biostat_212” (lots of resources
here on using Stata), the subfolders for “Papers” that include an archive of
some classic papers and other ones that influence my thinking and our work
together, and some other resources (fonts, scanned books) that I’ve posted in a
perhaps questionably broad interpretation of their UCSF licenses…</p>
</div>
<div id="lava-and-lavaquery" class="section level2">
<h2><span class="header-section-number">3.5</span> <a href="https://lava.ucsf.edu">LAVA and LAVAquery</a></h2>
<p>LAVA is the MAC’s primary database for all research-related patient and
participant information, e.g. demographics, visits and scheduling, research
diagnoses, specimens. It can only be accessed on a UCSF network, so if you need
to access it remotely, you’ll need to sign in to the UCSF VPN through Pulse
Secure (check out <a href="https://it.ucsf.edu/services/vpn" class="uri">https://it.ucsf.edu/services/vpn</a> for how to get the VPN set
up).</p>
<p>For our current projects, we use LAVA for the following:
* Getting participants’ contact information to call/email them about enrolling
in one of our studies
* Enrolling participants under the ‘Enrollment’ and ‘Scheduling’ tabs once we
have seen them for a study
* Looking up participants’ most recent (and past) diagnoses for tracking
enrollment numbers or running data analysis</p>
<p>LAVAQuery is a (fairly) user-friendly querying tool that allows you to pull
information from a selected subgroup of (or all) participants from the main LAVA
dataset. There is both an older excel-based version and a newer web-based
version. You can access these on the front page of the LAVA website.</p>
<p>If you will be running any kind of analysis, you’ll most likely use LAVAquery to
pull relevant participant information, download it as a csv file, and merge with
your study data files.</p>
<p>For training, visit the <a href="https://wiki.library.ucsf.edu/display/MACipedia/LAVA">LAVA</a> section of MACipedia and
watch the training videos under the ‘My Lava’ tab on the website.</p>
</div>
<div id="deprecateddiscouraged-tools" class="section level2">
<h2><span class="header-section-number">3.6</span> Deprecated/discouraged tools</h2>
<p><strong><del>Excel.</del></strong> In general, Microsoft Excel is not an appropriate tool for data
analysis or manipulations that are intended for presentation or publication. It
can be used to explore datasets, but usually this is best done within a proper
statistical/analytic software package such as R, Stata or Matlab. Excel does not
preserve a record of changes that are made to a data file, so if errors are
accidentally introduced they can be impossible to diagnose. Excel also has very
poor tools for automation and replication: if transformations are made to a
dataset and the dataset is later expanded with more observations, the same
transformations must usually be applied manually to the new entries. We do use
Excel sometimes to create or input data (e.g., for tracking participants) that
is then imported to stats packages, but here again the potential for introduced
errors is high so please proceed carefully! (Tools like REDCap and Access may be
better for this.) Finally, some of the data tools we use (Qualtrics, LAVAquery)
export csv and xls files–our general practice is to save them somewhere on the
R: drive and avoid ever touching or rewriting to them directly, only importing
from saved files into a proper stats package.</p>
<p><strong>Google Docs.</strong> In general, we have found that Google Docs is useful for
sharing short-term projects, such as an abstract or IRB submission that needs to
be edited by multiple people before submission. However, it has proven to be
unwieldy for archiving/storage/documentation–we’ve noted problems with
moving/deleting files, with governing permissions and file access, and in
general with organization. So anything that we might want to refer back to in a
matter of months or years should be appropriately organized in GitHub or the R:
drive.</p>
<p><strong>Box.</strong> In theory, Box should be awesome. It’s supported by UCSF, can handle
secure data like PHI, and can sync local copies to people’s individual
computers–so this should be one tool that can do most of what we use GitHub and
the R: Drive for. In practice, whenever we try to use Box for anything it
becomes super-frustrating and never seems to work appropriately. So we don’t use
it, but if anyone figures out how to use it effectively for shared work please
let me know…</p>
