# Project Management

Our work centers around four primary projects: 
1. Genes, Brains, and Decisions (GBD)
2. Neuroethics in Novel Neurotechnologies (Neurotech)
3. Decision-Making in Alzheimierâ€™s Disease and Related Dementias (DMA)   
4. Aging and Cognition 

Guidelines for managing each project can be found in the associated Standard Operating Procedure (SOP), each of which are 
located on the R-Drive:
* __DMA:__ R:\chiong\DMA
  
* __GBD:__ R:\chiong\GBD
  
* __Neurotech:__ R:\chiong\Neurotech
