In today’s seminar, we discussed ethical issues concerning the growing phenomenon of using off-label medical devices to 
treat uncommon pediatric disorders. As an example, [Dr. Philip Starr](https://profiles.ucsf.edu/philip.starr){:target="_blank"}
from the [UCSF Surgical Movement Disorders Clinic](https://surgicalmovementdisorders.ucsf.edu/){:target="_blank"} presented 
the case of a family pursuing deep brain stimulation to treat their 5-year-old child with a rare form of dystonia. Throughout 
our conversation, we referenced the [American _____](){}. 

Whole-genome sequencing has enabled identification of genetic mutations responsible for less common variants of movement 
disorders in children, for whom traditional therapies are unsuitable. Increasingly, parents of these patients seek experimental 
treatment options including off-label use of medical devices, an application made permissible via physician recommendation 
despite the absence of FDA approval. Though clinically promising, using medical devices off-label involves significant 
financial risk for patient families, as in the case described by Dr. Starr. Without guaranteed health insurance coverage 
for off-label treatment, the cost of which could exceed millions of dollars, we questioned whether screening families for 
socioeconomic status would be considered an unjust barrier to access or an appropriate protection against financial turmoil. 
We addressed parent-driven efforts to raise funds through online crowd-sourcing campaigns, and concerns about the 
contradiction between parents’ inaccurate, hyperbolic description of anticipated clinical outcomes on these platforms and 
the realistic expectations they previously expressed in-person with physicians. We also shared concerns about parents’ sense 
of desperation potentially clouding their ability to appreciate the financial burden, clinical limitations, and scarcity of 
research knowledge regarding off-label DBS.
