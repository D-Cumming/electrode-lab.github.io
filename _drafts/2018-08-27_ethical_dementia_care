During this works-in-progress style seminar, we reviewed a draft manuscript of a position paper for 
the American Academy of Neurology on ethical considerations in dementia care. Primary author, Winston Chiong, 
initiated our discussion by requesting content feedback with respect to the aim of thoroughly informing 
physician audiences. The input from members of diverse disciplines, including law, nursing, and social work, 
made for an enriching conversation about decision-making on behalf of patients without capacity, reconciling the 
robustness of genetic counseling and the popularity of direct-to-consumer genetic testing, and demystifying the 
roles of palliative care and Adult Protective Services. We frequently returned to the importance of ascertaining 
capacity as well as balancing patient safety and respect for autonomy, for instance, in the context of reporting 
dementia status to the DMV.

Satisfied with the breadth of information presented in the paper, we also proposed inclusion of recommended care 
strategies in order to equip physician readers with both the knowledge and skill necessary for ethical dementia care in practice.
