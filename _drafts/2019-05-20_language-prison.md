Adjunct UC Hasting College of Law professor, [Andrea Lollini](https://albalab.ucsf.edu/people/andrea-lollini){:target="_blank"}, 
presented preliminary findings from his ongoing pilot study on language-based learning disabilities (LLDs) 
within an all-female prison population. In collaboration with the [UCSF Alba Lab]( https://albalab.ucsf.edu/){:target="_blank"} 
and the [UCSF Dyslexia Center](https://dyslexia.ucsf.edu/){:target="_blank"}, this project aims to determine the prevalence of LLDs 
among incarcerated persons and develop standardized LLD screening tools and teaching methodologies for future use 
in prisons with the intention of reducing recidivism.

To date, Andrea and his study team have enrolled over 200 inmates for dyslexia screening through a series of exams 
including a medical intake, a social history interview, a neurodevelopmental history questionnaire, and a cognitive 
battery. We discussed the ethical challenges of administering these assessments within a correctional environment. 
Regarding consent, we discussed Andrea’s use of the teach-to-goal model as a solution to concerns regarding enrollment 
of participants deemed vulnerable due to their incarcerated status and potential cognitive deficits. Andrea also 
described the challenge of balancing his role as a mandated reporter of criminal behavior and his role as a research 
interviewer seeking to understand participant narratives and build rapport. He acknowledged the emotional toll endured 
by participants who share their traumatic experiences, as well as researchers who must exercise empathy while remaining 
within the bounds of the prison’s strict conduct policy. In considering the broader legal and social implications of 
this project, we reviewed the increasing rate of diagnosis for LLDs in the general US population; the relationship 
between LLDs, low educational attainment, and reduced employment access; and the present gap in knowledge regarding how 
LLDs specifically affect prison populations.
