During today’s seminar, Cailin Lechner presented on a collaborative project investigating consent in human intracranial electrophysiology 
studies. Generally, there is a regulatory gap in consent guidelines. Regulations and policies often attempt to provide recommendations on 
how to consent, yet fail to provide guidelines on which members of the study team could best obtain consent. This process can be further 
convoluted in studies involving human intracranial electrophysiology research because they require patients, who often have impaired 
decision-making capacity as a result of neurological disease, to consent to technically complex and high-risk neurosurgeries for primarily 
investigative, non-therapeutic purposes. As a result, the personnel responsible for going through the consent processes with patients and 
how they do it holds great influence on the ethical practices of the studies. 

The complexity of such studies suggests that consent would need to be done by someone with a high degree of expertise to ensure that participants are
aware of the intricacies of their involvement. This often means the neurosurgeon or clinician involved in the study. However, papers by
[Morain et al.]( https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/15265161.2019.1572811) {:target="_blank"} and 
[Da Silva et al.]( https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/15265161.2019.1572817) {:target="_blank"} have considered the ethical implications that this dual-role can have on the consent process, including that the role of the consenter influences prospective subjects’ decisions to participate in studies such that a clinician-investigator could lead to therapeutic misconception, conflicts of interest, or compromised voluntariness.

Cailin’s project involved interviewing 26 investigators from various human intracranial electrophysiology studies using semi-structured
interviews. The results found that most studies employed a hybrid approach to consent,
where more than one team member was involved in the consenting of potential participants. In these instances, a surgeon or principle 
investigator would be responsible for detailing the complexity of the surgery, while a second team member, usually a research coordinator,
would collect the consent. While there were different responses as to which team members or combination of team members ought to obtain 
consent, the rationale for determining who would obtain consent was contingent on several themes, including the need to provide expert 
knowledge, while also preserving the aspect of voluntariness, logistical needs like availability, regulatory guidance, and ethical 
instinct (where particular team members were chosen based on what seemed like the right thing to do).

Our following discussion centered primarily on navigating between the values of expertise and knowledge versus voluntariness in the 
consent process. We wondered if a non-physician team member could provide enough expertise to ensure that the patient was knowledgeable 
about his or her involvement and maintain the quality of the discussion while still preserving the voluntariness of consent. We then 
considered if IRB guidelines could help provide better consent processes if boards were more aware of the details of the experiments 
and what degree of understanding would be required in order to have informed consent. Finally, the group also acknowledged the need for
additional inquiries on whether or not patients believed if they were adequately informed or if they liked or would have preferred
being consented by certain team members, although we also recognized the influence that research outcomes may have on these types of 
post-hoc responses.
