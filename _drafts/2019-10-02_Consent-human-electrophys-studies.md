	During todayâ€™s seminar, Cailin Lechner presented on a collaborative project on consenting roles in human electrophysiology studies. 
  Generally, there is a regulatory gap in consent guidelines. Regulations and policies often attempt to provide recommendations on how
  to consent, yet fail to provide guidelines on which members of the study could best obtain consent. The consent process can be further
  convoluted in studies like human electrophysiology studies because they require patients, who often have impaired decision-making 
  capacity, to consent to technically complex and high-risk neurosurgeries for primarily investigative, non-therapeutic purposes. As a
  result, the personnel responsible for going through the consent processes with patients and how they do it holds great influence on 
  the ethical practices of the studies. 
  
	Using semi-structured interviews with investigators from various electrophysiology studies, the results found that dual-role consent 
  was often the method of consent for most of the studies included. In these instances, one team member, usually the surgeon or the 
  principal investigator, was responsible for detailing the complexity of the surgery while another team member, such as a research 
  coordinator, would collect the consent. Ultimately, determining who would obtain consent was contingent on several ethical themes, 
  including the need to provide expert knowledge, while also preserving the aspect of voluntariness, the potential for coercion that 
  investigators or clinicians may have on patients if the role of the consenter influenced responses about involvement, and which team
  members were best qualified to discuss the risks that the surgery and subsequent involvement in the research study provided (such as 
  its investigative, non-therapeutic nature, post-trial obligations, etc.).
  
	Our discussion centered on navigating between the values of expertise and knowledge versus the voluntariness in the consent process.
  We wondered if a non-physician team member could provide enough expertise to ensure that the patient was knowledgeable about his or
  her involvement to preserve the voluntariness of consent without compromising the quality of the discussion. We then considered if 
  IRB guidelines could help provide better consent processes if boards were better aware of the details of the experiment and what degree 
  of understanding would be required in order to have consent. Finally, the group also acknowledged the need for additional inquiries on
  whether or not patients believed if they were adequately informed or if they liked or would have preferred being consented by certain 
  team members, although we also recognized the influence that research outcomes may have on these types of post-hoc responses.
