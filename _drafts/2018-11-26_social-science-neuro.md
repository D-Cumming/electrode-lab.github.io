[Dan Dohan](https://profiles.ucsf.edu/dan.dohan){:target="\_blank"} and [Kate Rankin](https://memory.ucsf.edu/people/katherine-rankin-phd){:target="\_blank"} 
represented their academic specialties, sociology of medicine and neuropsychology, respectively, in this journal club seminar about 
*The Emerging Social Neuroscience of Justice Motivation* by Jean Decety and Keith J. Yoder. In addition to discussing the article, 
we broadly explored the connections between social neuroscience and the traditional social sciences. 


We began by distinguishing between cognitive neuroscience, a field which attempts to elucidate the neural mechanisms of knowledge 
acquisition and other mental processes, and *social* cognitive neuroscience, a sub-field which studies the correlation between brain 
systems and social behavior. We recognized sources of tension between these two disciplines, like neuroscientists’ critique of 
patient-based research methods within social neuroscience, and applauded examples of productive collaboration, particularly social 
neuroscientists’ contributions to research on personality change in neurodegenerative diseases.


We then asked whether social neuroscience, a field primarily concerned with workings “inside the head,” is capable of answering 
questions native to social science about phenomena “outside the head.” For instance, how can social neuroscientists truly understand 
justice, a principle that operates via social interactions, through analysis of individuals’ brains? Social scientists in our group 
also criticized the misappropriation of social science terminology in hard science research, and shed light on the academic insecurity 
felt within the social sciences in response to limited funding. We underscored the need for improved communication between social 
science and social neuroscience experts in order to refine interdisciplinary research questions and enhance comprehension of borrowed 
concepts. Regarding the value of social neuroscientific research about justice, we suggested that the data might reinforce existing 
evidence from social science literature, inform policy, and/or advance general knowledge, a scientific contribution valuable in and 
of itself.
