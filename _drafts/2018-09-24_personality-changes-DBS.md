In a journal club facilitated by Tobias Häusermann, we discussed the legitimacy of widespread unease within the neuroethics community 
that patients undergoing deep brain simulation (DBS) experience changes in personality, identity, agency, authenticity, autonomy, and 
self (PIAAAS). Using Frederic Gilbert’s *et al.* “Deflating the ‘DBS Causes Personality Changes’ Bubble” as a starting point for our 
conversation, we explored the apparent disconnect between theoretical neuroethics and clinical experience, as demonstrated by the scarcity 
of robust empirical evidence in over 1500 papers. However, we also acknowledged the risk of misinterpretation as a consequence 
of generalizing these studies, which address different aspects and applications of DBS.


Joined by researchers actively working with DBS systems, we discussed current treatment outcomes for patients with Parkinson’s disease, 
the potential for future treatment of psychiatric disorders, and the argument that specific brain targets warrant different levels of 
ethical concern. We noted the striking difference in public response to DBS compared to other therapeutic technologies, like cardiac 
pacemakers, and questioned whether overall fear of DBS stems from its actual clinical effects or its symbolic significance. With input 
from members of philosophy, sociology, and neurology, we considered how marketing and shifting cultural metaphors may influence public 
perception of DBS. Though in agreement that a formal reviewing body and established ethical guidelines for DBS research are needed, we 
continue to question the practicality of detecting DBS-induced changes in PIAAAS, given the challenge of ambiguous metrics and the 
behavioral changes inherent in neurodegenerative diseases, such as bvFTD and ALS.
