Galen Dods, from the [el-Samad lab](http://elsamadlab.ucsf.edu/), presented on the biotechnical processes and ethical issues
associated with new human brain model systems, called organoids, intended for neurological research. We framed our discussion
using “Comment: The Ethics of Experimenting with Human Brain Tissue” by Nita Farahany, Hank Greely *et al.*, a team of 
law and philosophy scholars. 


We began by defining organoids as structures resembling specific brain regions, mapping their derivation from pluripotent 
stem cells (PSCs), and comparing their utility to that of *ex vivo* brain tissue and chimeras. We acknowledged that eventual 
eradication of limits to organoid advancement, specifically their failure to vascularize *in vitro*, would enable departure 
from reliance on animal models for therapeutic testing, while also raising novel ethical dilemmas. Our group expressed 
concerns about adjusting informed consent for PSC donors, handling organoids post-research, and measuring sentience should 
organoids achieve this capacity. In future conversations, we hope to explore the cross-cultural significance of merging the
human and the non-human in research involving chimeras.
