UCSF neurologist and interventional pain specialist, [Prasad Shirvalkar](https://profiles.ucsf.edu/prasad.shirvalkar){:target="\_blank"}, facilitated a case discussion about the ethical dilemmas he 
and his team encounter in their ongoing research on adaptive deep brain stimulation (aDBS) for chronic pain. Informed by the 2016 
*neuromodulation* article, [“Unexpected complications of novel deep brain stimulation treatments: ethical issues and clinical 
recommendations”](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1111/ner.12613){:target="\_blank"} by Hannah Malsen et al., we deliberated how to obtain consent for unintended side-effects, and how to manage the 
researcher-patient relationship in highly collaborative, small-n trials.


Prasad’s study aims to identify new targets for chronic pain and develop a more personalized DBS paradigm. Stimulating the anterior 
cingulate cortex (ACC) in particular largely improves the affective dimension of pain such that participants are no longer bothered 
by pain despite remaining aware of its presence. However, stimulation of the ACC at high intensities, often required for pain relief, 
increases seizure risk. The potential for this adverse side-effect complicates various elements of the consent process, from capacity 
assessment to weighing benefits and costs. In seminar, we proposed exercising teach-back to assess participants’ comprehension of risks 
and disrupt the traditional doctor-patient social script, whereby patients accept doctors’ recommendations without question. A 
conversational approach to consent that prioritizes retention of key points, rather than one that operates under the assumption of 
capacity or involves repeated questioning of participants’ knowledge, produces informed participants while respecting their autonomy. 
We also recognized that participants’ ability to vividly imagine their lives with seizures may be skewed by their lack of having 
personally experienced a seizure, and/or their present focus on alleviating their chronic pain. 


The nature of this research setting, where aDBS generates therapeutic outcomes and participants equate project staff to care team members, 
effectively muddles the distinction between researcher and clinician. We shared our views on how researchers ought to navigate interactions
with participants, particularly in response to medical complaints and requests for non-immediate clinical services. Where a legal 
perspective might call for a rigid study protocol and emphasize the importance of semantics (e.g., “participant” rather than “patient”), 
an academic outlook might tolerate some blurring of the researcher-clinician boundary within the project design. We recognized the 
value of developing rapport with research participants while simultaneously upholding professionalism by judging when to redirect them to 
the appropriate clinical resources.
