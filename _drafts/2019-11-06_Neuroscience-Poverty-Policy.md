Emily Murphy led a works-in-progress investigating how neuroscience can reframe approaches to poverty policy. She began with the claim that
current policy/poverty mechanisms inherently have in them political assumptions about who is deserving of certain benefits and who is not. 
For example, bureaucratic disentitlement can often contain multiple steps and is intentionally complicated to filter applicants based on 
those who are most motivated to go through the trouble to apply and, thus, must be most deserving of the benefits. However, policies that
are made deliberately inconvenient in order to maintain the argument of justice ignores scientific evidence suggesting that poverty can 
lead to poor brain health and cognition, implying that poor individuals are not necessarily deserving of their inability to remove 
themselves from poverty. This evidence, Emily argued, indicates that measuring degrees of need or deservingness as current policies do can
actually be discriminatory against individuals who might really need it, but simply do not have the capacity to go through such onerous 
processes.

Emily continued that although science is not causal, it can make strong enough inferences to warrant a need to reframe current policies.
And if it shows that our assumptions about socioeconomic statuses and categories being meaningfully distinct is not true, then we have a
duty to reorganize those categories. However, she also acknowledge the difficulty in using descriptive science to argue for normative 
claims, and our discussion brainstormed the potential implications that reframing poverty policy in such a manner could lead to. First, 
it implies a sort of determinism to socioeconomic status; that poor people are somehow pre-determined to remain poor, which could prevent 
people from being motivated to work to improve themselves. Second, a scientifically claiming that poverty causes cognitive deficits 
implies that economic disadvantage is a form of cognitive disability. The group wondered if the distinction between this sort of 
disability as a result of economic deficit versus other factors was a meaningful enough justification. Reframing poverty this way also 
could lead to the stigmatization of poor people, who would now be seen as disabled, as well as an appropriation of disability and the 
efforts of disability rights. We also noted that while using such evidence to argue for changes in policy could be effective, it might
avoid greater normative points about how people ought to be treated.
