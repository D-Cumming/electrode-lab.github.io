I'm happy to say that I'll be participating on two panels about neuroethics in San Diego next month. I think both will 
open some space for really interesting discussions!

On Thursday, November 1 from 2:15-3:45pm I will be joining Jonathan Pugh, Cynthia Kubu, and Frederic Gilbert on an 
[International Neuroethics Society panel](https://www.neuroethicssociety.org/meeting-program){:target="\_blank"} 
moderated by Hannah Maslen on the topic of personality changes after deep brain stimulation. 

On Sunday, November 4 from 6:45-8:45pm I will be on a panel hosted by Elba Serrano and  Marcello Ienca, also 
featuring Andrea Giuffrida, Khara Ramos, Karen Rommelfanger, Ilina Singh, Tim Brown, Edda Thiels, Hank Greely, 
Ann Fink, and Judy Illes, during the 
[Society for Neuroscience Neuroethics Social](http://www.sfn.org/Meetings/Neuroscience-2018/Sessions-and-Events/SfN-Sponsored-Socials#Neuroethics-Social){:target="\_blank"}.
