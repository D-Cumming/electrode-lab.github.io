[Maya Katz](https://profiles.ucsf.edu/maya.katz){:target="\_blank"}, Assistant Professor of Neurology at the UCSF Movement Disorders
and Neuromodulation Center, led a works-in-progress session on her research about the Parkinson’s disease (PD) “mortality myth” and 
the benefits of incorporating palliative care into PD management. Joined by social workers, neurologists, and palliative care specialists, 
we voiced our perspectives on misconceptions about PD mortality and best practices for end-of-life conversations. 


The PD “mortality myth” refers to the misleading, yet ubiquitous claim that patients with PD do not die from PD, but rather from a 
ide-effect or PD-related ailment, such as aspiration pneumonia. We recognized the unfortunate perpetuation of this myth within cultural 
and clinical settings alike, criticizing inaccurate news media coverage and inadequate end-of-life planning for PD patients. Informed 
by anecdotes of frustrated caregivers and the disproportionately high rate of PD hospital deaths, we advocated for palliative care 
strategies as a means of reducing caregiver burden and improving patient quality of life. Additionally, we called for a patient-centered
approach to diagnosis delivery, as well as ongoing conversations about prognosis that address disease heterogeneity, cognitive decline, 
and potential comorbidities.
