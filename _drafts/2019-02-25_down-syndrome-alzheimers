For this journal club, we discussed the ethical challenges associated with neuropsychological testing and general care for patients 
with Down syndrome (DS), nearly 100 percent of whom develop Alzheimer’s disease (AD) neuropathological findings by age 40. [Melanie 
Stephens](https://profiles.ucsf.edu/melanie.stephens){:target="\_blank"}, a neuropsychologist, directed our conversation, during 
which we referenced two articles: [“Association of dementia with mortality among adults with Down Syndrome older than 35 years”]
(https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jamaneurology/fullarticle/2714719){:target="\_blank"} by Rosalyn Hithersay et al. (JAMA Neurology, 2019) 
and [“Enduring and emerging challenges of informed consent”](https://www.idcrp.org/sites/default/files/2-26%20Grady%20C%20%20%282015%29%20%20Enduring%20and%20Emerging%20Challenges%20of%20Informed%20Conse....pdf){:target="\_blank"} 
by Christine Grady (New England Journal of Medicine, 2015). 


AD is pervasive among DS patients as a consequence of triplication of the amyloid precursor protein (APP) gene on chromosome 21 and
increased life expectancy. As individuals with DS live longer, they transition from pediatrics to primary care, where physicians are 
unfamiliar with the mortality and morbidity risks associated with DS and aging. Cognitive evaluation resources for older DS patients 
at risk of developing AD are limited in availability and fraught with practical and ethical concerns. We questioned the feasibility 
of adjusting a traditionally 6-8 hour, single-day neuropsychological exam to accommodate patients with developmental disabilities and 
heightened distractibility. Would exam modifications intended to encourage patient cooperation, such as introducing snack breaks or 
playing a patient’s favorite music, constitute an infringement on free will or promote justice by protecting DS patients’ right to an 
evaluation? We compared this solution to public health efforts to design environments that nudge people toward making healthy choices, 
like taking the stairs over the elevator. In light of the lack of research on manifestations of AD specifically in patients with DS, we 
also considered whether such an exam and its existing metrics can produce meaningful data on DS patients’ cognitive abilities. 


We responded to anecdotes shared by Melanie and others about conflicting wishes of patients and caregivers regarding neuropsychological 
examination and research participation. Concerning DS patients’ capacity to consent, we supported respecting the decisions of those who 
currently have capacity, promoting the values of those who previously had capacity, and acting in the best interests of those who never
had capacity. It is unrealistic, however, for a neuropsychologist to thoroughly understand a patient’s unique values given the limited 
access to medical history and the brevity of the pre-evaluation interview. Despite the difficulties of the evaluation process, we 
acknowledged the importance of disclosing signs of cognitive decline to DS patients so they may plan for end-of-life. In recognition of 
stigma against individuals with DS (e.g., denial of dental care or medication on the basis of their presumed inability to manage bills 
and prescriptions), we stressed the urgent need for AD research in DS populations.
