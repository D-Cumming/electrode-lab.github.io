[JC Mergenthaler](/team/index.html#Joncarmen Mergenthaler) is now presenting at the [International Neuroethics Society meeting](https://www.neuroethicssociety.org/meeting-program){:target="_blank"}. 
His project includes data from 26 interviews of NIH-funded neurotechnology investigators conducting intracranial 
electrophysiology research in patients undergoing neurosurgical interventions, focusing on consent and recruitment 
procedures in this critical and potentially vulnerable population. If you're around at the meeting in San Diego, 
come by and say hi!
