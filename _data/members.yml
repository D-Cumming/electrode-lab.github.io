  description: I see myself as having three main jobs, which (I hope) inform one another.
              I am a **behavioral neurologist**, and my clinical practice focuses on 
              Alzheimer's disease, frontotemporal dementia, and other cognitive disorders of 
              aging. I am also a **cognitive neuroscientist**, applying observations from 
              clinic to investigate why patients like mine are vulnerable to making bad decisions. Third, I am 
              a **neuroethicist**, working alongside other clinicians, researchers, and policymakers
              to address the ethical and social implications of changes in decision-making due 
              to altered brain function. 

              
              I studied philosophy as an undergraduate at UC Berkeley. During medical school 
              here at UCSF, I took a leave to pursue a 
              PhD in philosophy at NYU, where I studied with Thomas Nagel and Derek Parfit. 
              After residency training in neurology back at UCSF, I did a combined fellowship in 
              cognitive neuroscience and neuroimaging with [Mark D'Esposito](https://despolab.berkeley.edu){:target="\_blank"} 
              at UC Berkeley and in behavioral neurology here at the [UCSF Memory and Aging Center](http://memory.ucsf.edu){:target="\_blank"}.
              
              
              Alongside my clinical and research work, I am Associate Director of 
              the [UCSF/UC Hastings Consortium on Law, Science and Health Policy](http://www.ucconsortium.org){:target="\_blank"}, 
              and am Co-Chair of the UCSF Department of Neurology [Diversity Committee](https://neurology.ucsf.edu/diversity){:target="\_blank"}. 
              I am a member of the UCSF Medical Center Ethics Committee, the [Neuroethics Working Group](https://www.braininitiative.nih.gov/about/neuroethics.htm){:target="\_blank"} 
              of the National Institutes of Health BRAIN (Brain Research through Advancing Innovative Neurotechnologies) 
              Multi-Council Working Group, and the American Academy of 
              Neurology's [Ethics, Law and Humanities Committee](https://www.aan.com/conferences-community/member-engagement/Learn-About-AAN-Committees/ethics-law-and-humanities-committee/){:target="\_blank"}.

  description: I am a Sociologist and Postdoctoral Fellow in the [UCSF Department of Neurology Memory and Aging Center](https://memory.ucsf.edu/){:target="\_blank"}, where my 
              research aims to elucidate the ethical concerns in existing clinical applications of closed-loop neuromodulation 
              in epilepsy as well as movement and mood disorders. I am also part of [UCSF's Institute for Health Policy Studies](https://healthpolicy.ucsf.edu/philip-r-lee-institute-health-policy-studies){:target="\_blank"} and 
              its newly established Medical Cultures Lab, a collaborative of social scientists working on methods innovations and 
              the culture of medicine.
              
              
              I received my PhD and Master of Philosophy degrees in sociology from the University of Cambridge, where I remain an 
              [Affiliated Researcher](https://research.sociology.cam.ac.uk/profile/tobias-haeusermann-0){:target="\_blank"}. During my doctoral studies I held a Research Fellowship at the [Amsterdam Institute for Social 
              Science Research](http://aissr.uva.nl/){:target="\_blank"} and was a member of its Long-term Care and Dementia group. I then conducted postdoctoral research 
              at the [Epidemiology, Biostatistics and Prevention Institute of the University of Zurich](https://www.ebpi.uzh.ch/en.html){:target="\_blank"} and for the [Department of 
              Health Sciences and Technology at ETH Zurich](https://www.hest.ethz.ch/en){:target="\_blank"}. Thereafter, I taught as student supervisor at the University of Cambridge 
              and was a visiting fellow at the [Ethox Centre](https://www.ethox.ox.ac.uk/){:target="\_blank"}, University of Oxford.
              
              
              I am particularly interested in how medical knowledge and care practices are interpreted differently in distinct 
              cultural settings. Beyond these specific research domains, I am also interested in aging studies, the sociology of 
              health and illness, comparative ethnographic research, and qualitative research methodologies.

  description:  As a someone who is interested in how social, behavioral, and cultural factors influence the trajectory
                of disease outcomes, I was naturally drawn to the interdisciplinary nature of the UCSF Decision Lab.
                My current role in the lab includes providing overall lab support, testing patients for the 
                [Decision-Making in Alzheimer's and Related Dementias project](/projects/index.html#dma), 
                helping screen patients for the [Neuroethics in Novel Neurotechnologies project](/projects/index.html#neurotech),
                and coordinating multicenter collaborations within the [ARTFL](https://www.rarediseasesnetwork.org/cms/artfl/){:target="\_blank"}/[LEFFTDS](https://memory.ucsf.edu/lefftds){:target="\_blank"} network for the [Genes, Brains and Decisions](/projects/index.html#gbd) project. 
                Additionally, I am involved in research on the psychosocial factors associated with caring for patients with neurodegenerative disease,
                participating in the Memory and Aging Center's community outreach team, and helping coordinate diversity efforts 
                targeted at increasing the number of underrepresented youth in science.
                
                 
             
                I studied molecular toxicology as an undergraduate at UC Berkeley, and previously conducted research on the structural factors
                associated with HIV transmission and acquisition rates amongst substance-using populations. Outside of work, 
                I am either volunteering at the [Berkeley Free Clinic](http://www.berkeleyfreeclinic.org/){:target="\_blank"}, photographing scenic landscapes, or training in mixed-martial arts.

  description:  'I received my B.A. in Cognitive Science from UC Berkeley. Prior to UCSF, I spent several years in the [Cortical Physiology Lab](http://cashlab.mgh.harvard.edu/){:target="\_blank"} 
                of Dr. Sydney Cash at Massachusetts General Hospital and Harvard Medical School. There, I studied the neurophysiology of 
                normal and pathophysiological brain activity at different scales using electrocorticography (ECoG), MEA, LFP, and EEG recordings. 
                
                
                In the Decision Lab, I’m involved in projects that seek to better understand the decision-making process as it relates to financial 
                decisions and neuroeconomic measures. The stuff of how we make decisions is fascinating, and in the future, I hope to pursue a line of 
                study that aligns the methods I  learned in the Cash Lab with the neuroeconomic principles of my current lab.'

  description:  As an undergraduate at UCLA, I studied human biology and society, a unique major dedicated to understanding how human health functions in both biological systems and larger societal contexts. 
                Through this interdisciplinary curriculum, I developed a deep interest in bioethics, specifically as it relates to promoting justice among vulnerable health populations. Whether executing my 
                senior research project on toxic exposure within a low-income, predominantly Latino neighborhood in south Los Angeles, or volunteering as executive director for a nonprofit that tutors and mentors 
                students in under-resourced public schools, I dedicated my college career to examining health and educational disparities. 
                
                
                My enthusiasm for assisting those whose health outcomes are unfairly hindered by biological, environmental and systemic factors led me to my current work as an Assistant Clinical Research Coordinator
                in the UCSF Decision Lab. In my role, I conduct patient recruitment and data management for the [Neuroethics in Novel Neurotechnologies](/projects/index.html#neurotech) project, which aims to integrate 
                ethics and neuroscience by investigating patient, family and clinician experiences with closed-loop brain devices. I also organize the [Neuroethics Seminar](/seminar/), an informal twice-monthly 
                meeting where participants from diverse disciplines deliberate ethical questions facing neurological research and clinical practice. I am motivated by the opportunity this position presents to advance 
                knowledge of neuroethics with the hope of improving patient care.
                
                
                Outside of work, I enjoy camping in national parks, listening to podcasts, and attending concerts, especially at intimate venues.

  description:  I have a deep fascination with the cognitive, attentional, and perceptual processes that impact how we pursue goals and make choices.
                As a Haas Scholar and senior in UC Berkeley’s psychology department honors program, I conducted research on the effect of income inequality on regulatory focus – a psychological mechanism that seeks to explain how we pursue goals.  
                For this work, I was the recipient of my department’s Warner Brown Memorial Prize.  Prior to completing my B.A. in psychology at UC Berkeley, I completed an A.A. in psychology at Foothill College where I undertook an independent 
                research project examining the role of empathy in promoting safer sex in the hookup culture, considering whether partner-focused language in sexual health information led to greater intent to practice safe sex in future encounters.
                
                
                
                I am beyond thrilled to be part of UCSF’s Decision Lab, where I hope to deepen my knowledge regarding the way we make decisions throughout our lifespans.
                In the lab, I am responsible for recruitment, task distribution, and data collection for the [Genes, Brains and Decisions](/projects/index.html#gbd) and [Online Studies of Decision-Making in Healthy Aging](/projects/index.html#agingcog) projects.
                I am excited about the possibilities these projects present for gaining greater insight into the relationship between behavioral economics and neurologically-driven individual variance.
                
                
                When not at work, I am a mom, a poet, and enjoy participating in improv comedy.
