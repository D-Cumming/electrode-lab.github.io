  description: I see myself as having three main jobs, which (I hope) inform one another.
              I am a **behavioral neurologist**, and my clinical practice focuses on 
              Alzheimer's disease, frontotemporal dementia, and other cognitive disorders of 
              aging. I am also a **cognitive neuroscientist**, applying observations from 
              clinic to investigate why my patients are vulnerable to making bad decisions. Third, I am 
              a **neuroethicist**, working alongside other clinicians, researchers, and policymakers
              to address the ethical and social implications of changes in decision-making due 
              to altered brain function. 

              
              I studied philosophy as an undergraduate at UC Berkeley. During medical school 
              here at UCSF, I took a leave to do a 
              PhD in philosophy at NYU, where I studied with Thomas Nagel and Derek Parfit. 
              After residency training in neurology back at UCSF, I did a combined fellowship in 
              cognitive neuroscience and neuroimaging with [Mark D'Esposito](https://despolab.berkeley.edu){:target="\_blank"} 
              at UC Berkeley and in behavioral neurology here at the [UCSF Memory and Aging Center](http://memory.ucsf.edu){:target="\_blank"}.
              
              
              Alongside my clinical and research work, I am Associate Director of 
              the [UCSF/UC Hastings Consortium on Law, Science and Health Policy](http://www.ucconsortium.org){:target="\_blank"}, 
              and am Co-Chair of the UCSF Department of Neurology [Diversity Committee](https://neurology.ucsf.edu/diversity){:target="\_blank"}. 
              I am a member of the UCSF Medical Center Ethics Committee, the [Neuroethics Division](https://www.braininitiative.nih.gov/about/neuroethics.htm){:target="\_blank"} 
              of the National Institutes of Health BRAIN (Brain Research through Advancing Innovative Neurotechnologies) 
              Multi-Council Working Group, and the American Academy of 
              Neurology's [Ethics, Law and Humanities Committee](https://www.aan.com/conferences-community/member-engagement/Learn-About-AAN-Committees/ethics-law-and-humanities-committee/){:target="\_blank"}.

  description: I am a Sociologist and Postdoctoral Fellow in the UCSF Department of Neurology Memory and Aging Center, where my 
              research aims to elucidate the ethical concerns in existing clinical applications of closed-loop neuromodulation 
              in epilepsy as well as movement and mood disorders. I am also part of the Institute for Health Policy Studies and 
              its newly established Medical Cultures Lab, a collaborative of social scientists working on methods innovations and 
              the culture of medicine.
              
              
              I received my PhD and Master of Philosophy degrees in sociology from the University of Cambridge, where I remain an 
              Affiliated Researcher. During my doctoral studies I held a Research Fellowship at the Amsterdam Institute for Social 
              Science Research and was a member of its Long-term Care and Dementia group. I then conducted postdoctoral research 
              at the Epidemiology, Biostatistics and Prevention Institute of the University of Zurich and for the Department of 
              Health Sciences and Technology at ETH Zurich. Thereafter, I taught as student supervisor at the University of Cambridge 
              and was a visiting fellow at the Ethox Centre, University of Oxford.
              
              
              I am particularly interested in how medical knowledge and care practices are interpreted differently in distinct 
              cultural settings. Beyond these specific research domains, I am also interested in aging studies, the sociology of 
              health and illness, comparative ethnographic research, and qualitative research methodologies.

  description:  I am the lead research coordinator for the UCSF Decision Lab. In this role, I oversee several
                research projects concerned with characterizing decision-making in patients with
                dementia. I am also involved in an independent research project that aims to discern the consequences of objectifying 
                attitudes when caring for such patients. I studied Nutritional Sciences & Molecular Toxicology as an undergraduate
                at UC Berkeley, where I conducted research on the social, behavioral, and psychological factors 
                associated with HIV transmission and acquisition rates amongst substance-using populations.
                
                
                
                My interests lie at the intersection of the social sciences and medicine, with a particular interest
                in how social determinants of health shape and influence disease outcomes. I was drawn to the 
                UCSF Decision Lab for both the interdisciplinary nature of the research and Dr. Chiong's longstanding
                interest in diversity and outreach. A fun fact about me is that in my spare time I am either volunteering
                at the Berkeley Free Clinic or training in mixed-martial arts.

  description: Mia is a research associate in the UCSF Decision Lab. She graduated from the University of 
              California, Berkeley with a degree in cognitive science. Mia works with Dr. Winston Chiong 
              to study decision-making behavior in aging and neurodegenerative disease. 
              

              Before joining the Decision Lab, Mia worked with Dr. Sydney Cash at Massachusetts General 
              Hospital, using electrocorticography (ECoG) to better understand normal and pathological brain 
              physiology.
