  description: I see myself as having three main jobs, which (I hope) inform one another.
              I am a **behavioral neurologist**, and my clinical practice focuses on 
              Alzheimer's disease, frontotemporal dementia, and other cognitive disorders of 
              aging. I am also a **cognitive neuroscientist**, applying observations from 
              clinic to investigate why patients like mine are vulnerable to making bad decisions. Third, I am 
              a **neuroethicist**, working alongside other clinicians, researchers, and policymakers
              to address the ethical and social implications of changes in decision-making due 
              to altered brain function. 

              
              I studied philosophy as an undergraduate at UC Berkeley. During medical school 
              here at UCSF, I took a leave to pursue a 
              PhD in philosophy at NYU, where I studied with Thomas Nagel and Derek Parfit. 
              After residency training in neurology back at UCSF, I did a combined fellowship in 
              cognitive neuroscience and neuroimaging with [Mark D'Esposito](https://despolab.berkeley.edu){:target="\_blank"} 
              at UC Berkeley and in behavioral neurology here at the [UCSF Memory and Aging Center](http://memory.ucsf.edu){:target="\_blank"}.
              
              
              Alongside my clinical and research work, I am Co-Chair of the UCSF Department of Neurology [Diversity Committee](https://neurology.ucsf.edu/diversity){:target="\_blank"} 
              and a member of the UCSF Medical Center Ethics Committee. Nationally, I serve on the [Neuroethics Working Group](https://www.braininitiative.nih.gov/about/neuroethics.htm){:target="\_blank"} 
              of the National Institutes of Health BRAIN (Brain Research through Advancing Innovative Neurotechnologies) 
              Multi-Council Working Group, and the American Academy of 
              Neurology's [Ethics, Law and Humanities Committee](https://www.aan.com/conferences-community/member-engagement/Learn-About-AAN-Committees/ethics-law-and-humanities-committee/){:target="\_blank"}.

  description: I am a Sociologist and Postdoctoral Fellow in the [UCSF Department of Neurology Memory and Aging Center](https://memory.ucsf.edu/){:target="\_blank"}, where my 
              research aims to elucidate the ethical concerns in existing clinical applications of closed-loop neuromodulation 
              in epilepsy as well as movement and mood disorders. I am also part of [UCSF's Institute for Health Policy Studies](https://healthpolicy.ucsf.edu/philip-r-lee-institute-health-policy-studies){:target="\_blank"} and 
              its newly established Medical Cultures Lab, a collaborative of social scientists working on methods innovations and 
              the culture of medicine.
              
              
              I received my PhD and Master of Philosophy degrees in sociology from the University of Cambridge, where I remain an 
              [Affiliated Researcher](https://research.sociology.cam.ac.uk/profile/dr-tobias-haeusermann){:target="\_blank"}. During my doctoral studies I held a Research Fellowship at the [Amsterdam Institute for Social 
              Science Research](http://aissr.uva.nl/){:target="\_blank"} and was a member of its Long-term Care and Dementia group. I then conducted postdoctoral research 
              at the [Epidemiology, Biostatistics and Prevention Institute of the University of Zurich](https://www.ebpi.uzh.ch/en.html){:target="\_blank"} and for the [Department of 
              Health Sciences and Technology at ETH Zurich](https://www.hest.ethz.ch/en){:target="\_blank"}. Thereafter, I taught as student supervisor at the University of Cambridge 
              for the ["Introduction to Sociology:Modern Societies I"](https://www.hsps.cam.ac.uk/prospective-students/subjects/sociology){:target="\blank"} and the paper 
              ["Social Context of Health and Illness"](https://www.biology.cam.ac.uk/undergrads/oldmvst/first/schi){:target="\_blank"} and was a visiting fellow at the 
              [Ethox Centre](https://www.ethox.ox.ac.uk/){:target="\_blank"}, University of Oxford.
              
              
              I am particularly interested in how medical knowledge and care practices are interpreted differently in distinct 
              cultural settings. Beyond these specific research domains, I am also interested in aging studies, the sociology of 
              health and illness, comparative ethnographic research, and qualitative research methodologies.

  description:  Movements are files of a person’s life, learned, reproduced, and altered as needed. There are external movements, those that make us act on objects and internal movements, an energy that we use in space and time. My interest in the body as a ‘depository of human expressiveness’ led me to a degree in Psychomotor Therapy with a Master’s specialization in old age and mental health (University of Lisbon). An enriching experience with an aging population triggered my interest in old age, and I realized how much I still had to learn about the biological and physiological mechanisms of aging and the disruptions that lead to age-related diseases. 
  
  
                My Master in Integrative Biology and Physiology, with specialization in Cognitive Neurosciences (Pierre and Marie Curie University, Paris), provided me with the basis for understanding brain aging mechanisms. My enthusiasm in this domain propelled me to pursue a PhD in Cognitive Neurosciences (Sorbonne University) at the Paris Brain Institute, working in the field of language in neurodegenerative diseases and the use of transcranial stimulation as a possible therapeutic approach. As movements, each word also has a biography that is related to the biography of the person using it. Understanding how one’s language abilities are affected during a disease process is another piece in the complex domain of neurodegeneration and its consequences on one’s identity.


                I am interested in understanding how an individual responds to aging in different spheres of life and how the identification of altered mechanisms in pathological aging can help prevent early cognitive and functional decline. By joining the Decision Lab at the Memory and Aging Center, I am excited to explore how the process of decision-making is affected and which are the neural basis that subtends decision-making alterations.

  description:  As an undergraduate at UCLA, I studied human biology and society, a unique major dedicated to understanding how human health functions in both biological systems and larger societal contexts. 
                Through this interdisciplinary curriculum, I developed a deep interest in bioethics, specifically as it relates to promoting justice among vulnerable health populations. Whether executing my 
                senior research project on toxic exposure within a low-income, predominantly Latino neighborhood in south Los Angeles, or volunteering as executive director for a nonprofit that tutors and mentors 
                students in under-resourced public schools, I dedicated my college career to examining health and educational disparities. 
                
                
                My enthusiasm for assisting those whose health outcomes are unfairly hindered by biological, environmental and systemic factors led me to my current work as an Assistant Clinical Research Coordinator
                in the UCSF Decision Lab. In my role, I conduct patient recruitment and data management for the [Neuroethics in Novel Neurotechnologies](/projects/index.html#neurotech) project, which aims to integrate 
                ethics and neuroscience by investigating patient, family and clinician experiences with closed-loop brain devices. I also organize the [Neuroethics Seminar](/seminar/), an informal twice-monthly 
                meeting where participants from diverse disciplines deliberate ethical questions facing neurological research and clinical practice. I am motivated by the opportunity this position presents to advance 
                knowledge of neuroethics with the hope of improving patient care.
                
                
                Outside of work, I enjoy camping in national parks, listening to podcasts, and attending concerts, especially at intimate venues.

  description:  My curiosity about human behavior's underlying mechanisms led me to become a UC Davis biopsychology major, where I spent my time as an undergraduate entrenched in cognitive neuroscience research. 
                I was fortunate enough to work under the guidance of (then) graduate student, Dr. Trevor Brothers, whose contagious passion for linguistics, desire to teach, and electrophysiological expertise gifted 
                me the foundation necessary to work in Dr. Steve Luck's Laboratory for Basic and Translational Cognitive Neuroscience. After getting a grasp on EEG/ERPs and extending my interest in language processing
                to attention and visual working memory, I decided to take a break from research and gain clinical experience as a psychometrist in hopes of understanding cognition from a different vantage point. 
                Combining my clinical and research experience, I was eager to revisit academia and join the Decision Lab to contribute to science once again.


                Upon joining the lab, I started working on the Decision-Making in Alzheimer's and Related Dementias study, where I collected data and began analyzing our Generalized Axiom of Revealed Preferences data. 
                I later transitioned to developing E-Prime and Qualtrics instruments during my ownership of organizing the multi-national ALLFTD (ARTFL-LEFFTDS) recruitment for our Genes, Brains and Decisions project. 
                Although my responsibilities have recently shifted to see that the lab runs smoothly, I hope to continue developing my understanding of behavioral economics,  programming, and statistics.


                When I'm not working, I enjoy singing songs about my favorite Liverpool FC players, rock climbing, playing soccer, and, more recently, unsuccessfully prospecting for gold!

  description:  The Decision Lab is the perfect home for my interdisciplinary interests. I received my undergraduate degree in Neuroscience at the University of Alabama at Birmingham, where I conducted research on Alzheimer’s disease. While there I also took several philosophy courses, which introduced me to the field of bioethics. 
                I became so enamored with the subject that I went to study for a Master’s in Bioethics at Emory University in Atlanta, Georgia. I had the opportunity to conduct work with a lab studying deep brain stimulation as a potential therapy for treatment resistant depression. 
                My thesis project analyzed patient perspectives to respond to the ethical concerns and implications of DBS for depression, particularly as it relates to themes of identity.
                
                
                My experience in neuroethics and neurotechnology led me to San Francisco and UCSF, where I work as a research coordinator in the Decision Lab for the [Neuroethics in Novel Neurotechnologies](/projects/index.html#neurotech) study. 
                The project involves observing and interviewing patients, caregivers, and providers in order to identify and respond to concerns regarding the ethics of closed-loop deep brain stimulation. I see value in the perspectives that these narratives can provide as we develop best practices for novel neurotechnologies. 
                More broadly, however, I am also curious as to how such advancements in therapeutic technologies can challenge our society’s perception of itself and its values. Beyond this project, I also organize the [Neuroethics Seminar](/seminar/), a twice-monthly interdisciplinary discussion on ethics-related questions that arise from neuroscience research and clinical neurology practice. 
                
                
                In my free time, I enjoy keeping up to date with the newest films and shows, trying to find the best bites in San Francisco, and pretending that I am half as good at rock climbing as the rest of the SF population.

  description:  Research was an integral part of my undergraduate experience at Stanford University, where I spent four years studying dynamic stem cell behaviors and tumor development. Working at the bench ignited my curiosity to explore and solve difficult questions about the natural world.
  
  
                Though bench research consumed much of my time in these four years, I also dedicated time for community engagement work with vulnerable low-income and migrant communities.
                One experience I deeply cherish is my years spent volunteering at the university's pediatric hospital, where I got the opportunity to connect with migrant children living with a host of conditions and diseases. Their spirit was a grounding and reassuring force for me all throughout
                college. 
                
                
                For a long time, these two parts of my life remained separate. It gradually became apparent to me, however, the disconnect between my research and the patients I interfaced with in the hospital and the wider community. My efforts to find an intersection between these two led me to the Decision Lab, where I 
                manage the [Decision-Making in Alzheimer's and Related Dementias](/projects/index.html#dma) study. I am excited to extend my love for research to a clinical field that centers on the individual and the human experience.
                
                
                In my free time, I enjoy reading, cooking comfort food, volunteering with migrant communities, and watching YouTube videos.

  description: I am transitioning from a former career as a Ballet dancer to a field of medicine, science, and groundbreaking clinical research. I graduated Magna Cum Laude with a Performing Arts Degree in the Liberal Education for Arts Professionals program at Saint Mary’s College of California. I am also earning an
               Associate’s degree in the field of Biological Sciences at Canada College. Among several extracurricular activities, I also enjoyed being a part of the Phi Theta Kappa Honor Society and the Alpha Gamma Sigma Honor Society.
  
  
               While focusing on my artistry as a ballerina, I enjoyed traveling the world and experiencing unique cultures. In my dance career, I was awarded the Princess Grace Award, a Congressional Black Caucus Foundation’s Performing Arts Medal, and the Chris Hellman Award, among other newspaper and magazine features.
               While I appreciate and value my time in the dance world, I always knew that I would like to go into medicine one day. 
 
 
               I discovered my passion for research during my time as an NIH researcher in the Bridges to Baccalaureate Program through SF State University. In this program, I acquired laboratory skills and presented on various research projects. I enjoy volunteering at the UCSF Benioff Children’s Hospital and at Shanti 
               Project, where I was grateful to be named the Spotlight Volunteer in Shanti’s Spring 2019 Newsletter. I am thrilled to provide emotional support and practical assistance for both children in the hospital and assisting aging adults with disabilities in Shanti.
 
 
               Compassion for our elderly with dementia is a value that is essential in society, so I am incredibly interested in researching and assisting with projects that enhance their quality of life. This is one of many reasons I believe in and value the research at the UCSF Memory and Aging Center and why I’m 
               excited about the work that I am doing as a member of the Decision lab, specifically on the [Genes, Brains and Decisions](/projects/index.html#gbd) Project. The insightful knowledge, experience, and abilities I will learn while working at UCSF’s world-class facility will better prepare me for my future as a physician and researcher.
 
 
               In my spare time, I enjoy swimming, hiking, reading, and Pilates.

  description:  I first obtained my BA in psychology (Aristotle University of Thessaloniki, Greece). As a bachelor thesis student, I was introduced to the fascinating world of research by undertaking a behavioral study probing the association between cheating, creativity and moral reasoning. The question which psychological mechanisms tilt our moral compass sparked my interest. 
                However, pieces were definitely missing from understanding such a perplex topic in depth. 
                
                
                
                My MS in Neural and Behavioural Sciences (University of Tubingen, Germany) provided a bigger piece to the puzzle by giving me the opportunity to work out interdisciplinary questions such as how cognitive enhancers affect cheating upon monetary payoff (Oxford University, UK) and how arousal mediates different contexts of lying (Max Planck Institute for Research on Collective Goods, Germany).
                
                
                
                Now, being part of the Decision Lab at the Memory and Aging Center, I am thrilled to have the opportunity to add another, major piece, dementia. In other words, investigating conditions characterized notably by impairment of memory and judgment.
                In the lab, I am responsible for fMRI task design, data collection and analysis for the [Decision-Making in Alzheimer's and Related Dementias](/projects/index.html#dma) and the [Online Studies of Decision-Making in Healthy Aging](/projects/index.html#agingcog) projects. 
                Some questions I am eager to examine is how moral reasoning, dishonest behavior and overall value based decision making processes are altered in different types of dementia, including corresponding brain areas.

                 
                In my free time I enjoy dancing, hiking and camping. When I experience a rush of adrenaline I am most likely trying to surf.

  description: During my undergraduate studies I was able to accumulate a broad range of experiences.  I received my B.S. in Physiology and became involved with research through studying and completing my Honors thesis project on the effects of amniotic membrane application on post-infarct cardiac remodeling.
              Additionally, I received a minor in Health and Human Values which introduced me to the way social, political, and institutional values, norms, and policies affect the health of different patient populations.
              
              
              To supplement my understanding of these concepts, I worked as an intern developing a cervical cancer screening intervention at a family clinic with a largely underserved patient population.
              I also completed a capstone project highlighting ways the current sex education system fails to provide adolescents with necessary sexual health information.
              
              
              In addition to these projects, I was able to gain first hand clinical experience by working as an EMT and then later as a patient care technician in the hospital.
              Although I enjoyed being able to interact with patients in these roles, I missed the academic aspect that I experienced working in research.
              
              
              I am grateful to currently be working as a clinical research coordinator in the Decision Lab, as well as Dr. David Perry’s lab, where I am able to work in an integrated clinical and academic environment.
              In the Decision Lab I manage the psychophysiology testing for [Genes, Brains and Decisions](/projects/index.html#gbd).  This allows me to interact with current patients, and also contribute to academic knowledge which can inform better health care for future patients.
              
              
              When I’m not at work I enjoy hiking, working out, and trying all of the best brunch places SF has to offer.
