  description: I see myself as having three main jobs, which (I hope) inform one another.
              I am a **behavioral neurologist**, and my clinical practice focuses on 
              Alzheimer's disease, frontotemporal dementia, and other cognitive disorders of 
              aging. I am also a **cognitive neuroscientist**, applying observations from 
              clinic to investigate why my patients are vulnerable to making bad decisions. Third, I am 
              a **neuroethicist**, working alongside other clinicians, researchers, and policymakers
              to address the ethical and social implications of changes in decision-making due 
              to altered brain function. 

              
              I studied philosophy as an undergraduate at UC Berkeley. During medical school 
              here at UCSF, I took a leave to do a 
              PhD in philosophy at NYU, where I studied with Thomas Nagel and Derek Parfit. 
              After residency training in neurology back at UCSF, I did a combined fellowship in 
              cognitive neuroscience and neuroimaging with [Mark D'Esposito](https://despolab.berkeley.edu){:target="\_blank"} 
              at UC Berkeley and in behavioral neurology here at the [UCSF Memory and Aging Center](http://memory.ucsf.edu){:target="\_blank"}.
              
              
              Alongside my clinical and research work, I am Associate Director of 
              the [UCSF/UC Hastings Consortium on Law, Science and Health Policy](http://www.ucconsortium.org){:target="\_blank"}, 
              and am Co-Chair of the UCSF Department of Neurology [Diversity Committee](https://neurology.ucsf.edu/diversity){:target="\_blank"}. 
              I am a member of the UCSF Medical Center Ethics Committee, the [Neuroethics Division](https://www.braininitiative.nih.gov/about/neuroethics.htm){:target="\_blank"} 
              of the National Institutes of Health BRAIN (Brain Research through Advancing Innovative Neurotechnologies) 
              Multi-Council Working Group, and the American Academy of 
              Neurology's [Ethics, Law and Humanities Committee](https://www.aan.com/conferences-community/member-engagement/Learn-About-AAN-Committees/ethics-law-and-humanities-committee/){:target="\_blank"}.

  description: I received a B.Sc. in Communication Studies from the University of Applied Sciences 
                Zürich and an M.Phil in Sociology from Cambridge University. 
                I then went on to complete my PhD at the Cambridge Department of Sociology, where 
                I remain an Affiliated Researcher. During my doctoral studies, I was also a student 
                supervisor for the Social Context of Health and Illness seminar at the Cambridge Department 
                of Biology, where I instructed undergraduate students for the pre-clinical course within 
                the Medical and Veterinary Sciences Tripos. My PhD dissertation is titled ‘Lest We Forget 
                - Dementia Care and Community’. Based on ethnographic fieldwork in Germany’s first Dementia 
                Village, I demonstrate the local dynamics and practices by which people with dementia and 
                their care takers are reciprocally constituted. During my ethnographic fieldwork, I held 
                a Research Fellowship at the Amsterdam Institute for Social Science Research and was a 
                visiting member of the Long-term Care and Dementia group at the Centre for Social Science 
                and Global Health at the University of Amsterdam.
                
                
                I am particularly interested in how medical knowledge and care practices are interpreted 
                differently in distinct cultural settings. Beyond these specific research domains, I am 
                also interested in the sociology of health and illness, comparative ethnographic research, 
                and qualitative research methodologies.

  description:  I am the lead research coordinator for the UCSF Decision Lab. In this role, I oversee several
                research projects concerned with characterizing decision-making in patients with
                dementia. I am also involved in an independent research project that aims to discern the consequences of objectifying 
                attitudes when caring for such patients. I studied Nutritional Sciences & Molecular Toxicology as an undergraduate
                at UC Berkeley, where I conducted research on the social, behavioral, and psychological factors 
                associated with HIV transmission and acquisition rates amongst substance-using populations.
                
                
                
                My interests lie at the intersection of the social sciences and medicine, with a particular interest
                in how social determinants of health shape and influence disease outcomes. I was drawn to the 
                UCSF Decision Lab for both the interdisciplinary nature of the research and Dr. Chiong's longstanding
                interest in diversity and outreach. A fun fact about me is that in my spare time I am either volunteering
                at the Berkeley Free Clinic or training in mixed-martial arts.

              California, Berkeley with a degree in cognitive science. Mia works with Dr. Winston Chiong 
              to study decision-making behavior in aging and neurodegenerative disease. 
              

              Before joining the Decision Lab, Mia worked with Dr. Sydney Cash at Massachusetts General 
              Hospital, using electrocorticography (ECoG) to better understand normal and pathological brain 
              physiology.
