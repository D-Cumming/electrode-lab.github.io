  description: I see myself as having three main jobs, which (I hope) inform one another.
              I am a **behavioral neurologist**, and my clinical practice focuses on 
              Alzheimer's disease, frontotemporal dementia, and other cognitive disorders of 
              aging. I am also a **cognitive neuroscientist**, applying observations from 
              clinic to investigate why my patients are vulnerable to making bad decisions. Third, I am 
              a **neuroethicist**, working alongside other clinicians, researchers, and policymakers
              to address the ethical and social implications of changes in decision-making due 
              to altered brain function. 

              
              I studied philosophy as an undergraduate at UC Berkeley. During medical school 
              here at UCSF, I took a leave to do a 
              PhD in philosophy at NYU, where I studied with Thomas Nagel and Derek Parfit. 
              After residency training in neurology back at UCSF, I did a combined fellowship in 
              cognitive neuroscience and neuroimaging with [Mark D'Esposito](https://despolab.berkeley.edu){:target="\_blank"} 
              at UC Berkeley and in behavioral neurology here at the [UCSF Memory and Aging Center](http://memory.ucsf.edu){:target="\_blank"}.
              
              
              Alongside my clinical and research work, I am Associate Director of 
              the [UCSF/UC Hastings Consortium on Law, Science and Health Policy](http://www.ucconsortium.org){:target="\_blank"}, 
              and am Co-Chair of the UCSF Department of Neurology [Diversity Committee](https://neurology.ucsf.edu/diversity){:target="\_blank"}. 
              I am a member of the UCSF Medical Center Ethics Committee, the [Neuroethics Division](https://www.braininitiative.nih.gov/about/neuroethics.htm){:target="\_blank"} 
              of the National Institutes of Health BRAIN (Brain Research through Advancing Innovative Neurotechnologies) 
              Multi-Council Working Group, and the American Academy of 
              Neurology's [Ethics, Law and Humanities Committee](https://www.aan.com/conferences-community/member-engagement/Learn-About-AAN-Committees/ethics-law-and-humanities-committee/){:target="\_blank"}.

  description: I am a Sociologist and Postdoctoral Fellow in the UCSF Department of Neurology Memory and Aging Center, where my 
              research aims to elucidate the ethical concerns in existing clinical applications of closed-loop neuromodulation 
              in epilepsy as well as movement and mood disorders. I am also part of the Institute for Health Policy Studies and 
              its newly established Medical Cultures Lab, a collaborative of social scientists working on methods innovations and 
              the culture of medicine.
              
              
              I received my PhD and Master of Philosophy degrees in sociology from the University of Cambridge, where I remain an 
              Affiliated Researcher. During my doctoral studies I held a Research Fellowship at the Amsterdam Institute for Social 
              Science Research and was a member of its Long-term Care and Dementia group. I then conducted postdoctoral research 
              at the Epidemiology, Biostatistics and Prevention Institute of the University of Zurich and for the Department of 
              Health Sciences and Technology at ETH Zurich. Thereafter, I taught as student supervisor at the University of Cambridge 
              and was a visiting fellow at the Ethox Centre, University of Oxford.
              
              
              I am particularly interested in how medical knowledge and care practices are interpreted differently in distinct 
              cultural settings. Beyond these specific research domains, I am also interested in aging studies, the sociology of 
              health and illness, comparative ethnographic research, and qualitative research methodologies.

  description:  I provide varying levels of support to our research projects, and the degree to which I provide support
                is dependent on the context and constraints of each individual project. Much of my work involves shifting
                between the "big picture" of our research interests and the small-but-crucial details that are 
                necessary to conduct our research aims. In addition to this work, I am involved in research on the psychosocial 
                factors associated with caring for patients with neurodegenerative disease. I studied molecular toxicology as
                an undergraduate at UC Berkeley, where I conducted research on the social, behavioral, and psychological factors
                associated with HIV transmission and acquisition rates amongst substance-using populations.  
                
                
                
                My interests lie at the intersection of the social sciences and medicine, with a particular interest
                in how social determinants of health shape and influence disease outcomes. I was drawn to the 
                UCSF Decision Lab for both the interdisciplinary nature of the research and Dr. Chiong's longstanding
                interest in diversity and outreach. Outside of work, I am either volunteering
                at the Berkeley Free Clinic or training in mixed-martial arts.
