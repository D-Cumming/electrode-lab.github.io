  description: I see myself as having three main jobs, which (I hope) inform one another.
              I am a **behavioral neurologist**, and my clinical practice focuses on 
              Alzheimer's disease, frontotemporal dementia, and other cognitive disorders of 
              aging. I am also a **cognitive neuroscientist**, applying observations from 
              clinic to investigate why patients like mine are vulnerable to making bad decisions. Third, I am 
              a **neuroethicist**, working alongside other clinicians, researchers, and policymakers
              to address the ethical and social implications of changes in decision-making due 
              to altered brain function. 

              
              I studied philosophy as an undergraduate at UC Berkeley. During medical school 
              here at UCSF, I took a leave to pursue a 
              PhD in philosophy at NYU, where I studied with Thomas Nagel and Derek Parfit. 
              After residency training in neurology back at UCSF, I did a combined fellowship in 
              cognitive neuroscience and neuroimaging with [Mark D'Esposito](https://despolab.berkeley.edu){:target="\_blank"} 
              at UC Berkeley and in behavioral neurology here at the [UCSF Memory and Aging Center](http://memory.ucsf.edu){:target="\_blank"}.
              
              
              Alongside my clinical and research work, I am a member of the UCSF Department of Neurology [Diversity Committee](https://neurology.ucsf.edu/diversity){:target="\_blank"} 
              and the UCSF Medical Center Ethics Committee. Nationally, I serve on the [Neuroethics Working Group](https://www.braininitiative.nih.gov/about/neuroethics.htm){:target="\_blank"} 
              of the National Institutes of Health BRAIN (Brain Research through Advancing Innovative Neurotechnologies) 
              Multi-Council Working Group, and the American Academy of 
              Neurology's [Ethics, Law and Humanities Committee](https://www.aan.com/conferences-community/member-engagement/Learn-About-AAN-Committees/ethics-law-and-humanities-committee/){:target="\_blank"}.

              research aims to elucidate the ethical concerns in existing clinical applications of closed-loop neuromodulation 
              in epilepsy as well as movement and mood disorders. I am also part of [UCSF's Institute for Health Policy Studies](https://healthpolicy.ucsf.edu/philip-r-lee-institute-health-policy-studies){:target="\_blank"} and

              I received my PhD and Master of Philosophy degrees in sociology from the University of Cambridge, where I remain an 
              [Affiliated Researcher](https://research.sociology.cam.ac.uk/profile/dr-tobias-haeusermann){:target="\_blank"}. During my doctoral studies I held a Research Fellowship at the [Amsterdam Institute for Social 
              Science Research](http://aissr.uva.nl/){:target="\_blank"} and was a member of its Long-term Care and Dementia group. I then conducted postdoctoral research 
              at the [Epidemiology, Biostatistics and Prevention Institute of the University of Zurich](https://www.ebpi.uzh.ch/en.html){:target="\_blank"} and for the [Department of 
              Health Sciences and Technology at ETH Zurich](https://www.hest.ethz.ch/en){:target="\_blank"}. Thereafter, I taught as student supervisor at the University of Cambridge 
              for the ["Introduction to Sociology:Modern Societies I"](https://www.hsps.cam.ac.uk/prospective-students/subjects/sociology){:target="\blank"} and the paper 
              ["Social Context of Health and Illness"](https://www.biology.cam.ac.uk/undergrads/oldmvst/first/schi){:target="\_blank"} and was a visiting fellow at the 
              [Ethox Centre](https://www.ethox.ox.ac.uk/){:target="\_blank"}, University of Oxford.
              
              
              I am particularly interested in how medical knowledge and care practices are interpreted differently in distinct 
              cultural settings. Beyond these specific research domains, I am also interested in aging studies, the sociology of 
              health and illness, comparative ethnographic research, and qualitative research methodologies.

  description:  Movements are files of a person’s life, learned, reproduced, and altered as needed. There are external movements, those that make us act on objects and internal movements, an energy that we use in space and time. 
                My interest in the body as a ‘depository of human expressiveness’ led me to a degree in Psychomotor Therapy with a Master’s specialization in old age and mental health (University of Lisbon). An enriching experience with an aging population triggered my interest in old age, 
                and I realized how much I still had to learn about the biological and physiological mechanisms of aging and the disruptions that lead to age-related diseases. 
  
  
                My Master in Integrative Biology and Physiology, with specialization in Cognitive Neurosciences (Pierre and Marie Curie University, Paris), provided me with the basis for understanding brain aging mechanisms. 
                My enthusiasm in this domain propelled me to pursue a PhD in Cognitive Neurosciences (Sorbonne University) at the Paris Brain Institute, working in the field of language in neurodegenerative diseases and the use of transcranial stimulation as a possible therapeutic approach. 
                As movements, each word also has a biography that is related to the biography of the person using it. Understanding how one’s language abilities are affected during a disease process is another piece in the complex domain of neurodegeneration and its consequences on one’s identity.


                I am interested in understanding how an individual responds to aging in different spheres of life and how the identification of altered mechanisms in pathological aging can help prevent early cognitive and functional decline. 
                By joining the Decision Lab at the Memory and Aging Center, I am excited to explore how the process of decision-making is affected and which are the neural basis that subtends decision-making alterations.

  description: I am a behavioral neurology fellow at the Memory and Aging Center and joined the Decision Lab to better understand decision making, 
               and ultimately help patients with cognitive or behavioral impairments better navigate our complex world. 
 
               As an undergraduate studying economics at the University of Michigan it was fascinating and terrifying to learn that the overwhelming
               majority of economic theory, used to govern policy decisions large and small, assumed all humans behaved perfectly rationally at all 
               times (Homo economicus). While the burgeoning field of behavioral economics is appropriately challenging these long-held beliefs, 
               the underlying neural mechanisms governing complex decision making remain relatively elusive – though they can clearly be observed to
               break down in patients suffering from neurological and psychiatric illness. Neurologists frequently observe aging patients with 
               cognitive impairment to be more susceptible to financial scams, in extreme cases leading to complete financial catastrophe. 
               I am excited to join the Decision Lab to further our understanding of the neural basis of complex decision making, including 
               financial decision making, and hopefully find ways to better monitor at risk patients and intervene before they make potentially 
               devastating mistakes. 
 
               Between my time at the University of Michigan and joining the MAC, I attended medical school at Case Western Reserve University
               and completed residency at the University of Colorado in Denver. In my free time I enjoy reading, running, playing the guitar, 
               and more recently am trying to decide whether to forgive the Giants for sweeping my Tigers in 2012, or just root for the As.

  description:  My curiosity about human behavior's underlying mechanisms led me to become a UC Davis biopsychology major, where I spent my time as an undergraduate entrenched in cognitive neuroscience research. 
                I was fortunate enough to work under the guidance of (then) graduate student, Dr. Trevor Brothers, whose contagious passion for linguistics, desire to teach, and electrophysiological expertise gifted 
                me the foundation necessary to work in Dr. Steve Luck's Laboratory for Basic and Translational Cognitive Neuroscience. After getting a grasp on EEG/ERPs and extending my interest in language processing
                to attention and visual working memory, I decided to take a break from research and gain clinical experience as a psychometrist in hopes of understanding cognition from a different vantage point. 
                Combining my clinical and research experience, I was eager to revisit academia and join the Decision Lab to contribute to science once again.


                Upon joining the lab, I started working on the Decision-Making in Alzheimer's and Related Dementias study, where I collected data and began analyzing our Generalized Axiom of Revealed Preferences data. 
                I later transitioned to developing E-Prime and Qualtrics instruments during my ownership of organizing the multi-national ALLFTD (ARTFL-LEFFTDS) recruitment for our Genes, Brains and Decisions project. 
                Although my responsibilities have recently shifted to see that the lab runs smoothly, I hope to continue developing my understanding of behavioral economics,  programming, and statistics.


                When I'm not working, I enjoy singing songs about my favorite Liverpool FC players, rock climbing, playing soccer, and, more recently, unsuccessfully prospecting for gold!

  description:  The Decision Lab is the perfect home for my interdisciplinary interests. I received my undergraduate degree in Neuroscience at the University of Alabama at Birmingham, where I conducted research on Alzheimer’s disease. While there I also took several philosophy courses, which introduced me to the field of bioethics. 
                I became so enamored with the subject that I went to study for a Master’s in Bioethics at Emory University in Atlanta, Georgia. I had the opportunity to conduct work with a lab studying deep brain stimulation as a potential therapy for treatment resistant depression. 
                My thesis project analyzed patient perspectives to respond to the ethical concerns and implications of DBS for depression, particularly as it relates to themes of identity.
                
                
                My experience in neuroethics and neurotechnology led me to San Francisco and UCSF, where I work as a research coordinator in the Decision Lab for the [Neuroethics in Novel Neurotechnologies](/projects/index.html#neurotech) study. 
                The project involves observing and interviewing patients, caregivers, and providers in order to identify and respond to concerns regarding the ethics of closed-loop deep brain stimulation. I see value in the perspectives that these narratives can provide as we develop best practices for novel neurotechnologies. 
                More broadly, however, I am also curious as to how such advancements in therapeutic technologies can challenge our society’s perception of itself and its values. Beyond this project, I also organize the [Neuroethics Seminar](/seminar/), a twice-monthly interdisciplinary discussion on ethics-related questions that arise from neuroscience research and clinical neurology practice. 
                
                
                In my free time, I enjoy keeping up to date with the newest films and shows, trying to find the best bites in San Francisco, and pretending that I am half as good at rock climbing as the rest of the SF population.

  description: I am transitioning from a former career as a Ballet dancer to a field of medicine, science, and groundbreaking clinical research. I graduated Magna Cum Laude with a Performing Arts Degree in the Liberal Education for Arts Professionals program at Saint Mary’s College of California. I am also earning an
               Associate’s degree in the field of Biological Sciences at Canada College. Among several extracurricular activities, I also enjoyed being a part of the Phi Theta Kappa Honor Society and the Alpha Gamma Sigma Honor Society.
  
  
               While focusing on my artistry as a ballerina, I enjoyed traveling the world and experiencing unique cultures. In my dance career, I was awarded the Princess Grace Award, a Congressional Black Caucus Foundation’s Performing Arts Medal, and the Chris Hellman Award, among other newspaper and magazine features.
               While I appreciate and value my time in the dance world, I always knew that I would like to go into medicine one day. 
 
 
               I discovered my passion for research during my time as an NIH researcher in the Bridges to Baccalaureate Program through SF State University. In this program, I acquired laboratory skills and presented on various research projects. I enjoy volunteering at the UCSF Benioff Children’s Hospital and at Shanti 
               Project, where I was grateful to be named the Spotlight Volunteer in Shanti’s Spring 2019 Newsletter. I am thrilled to provide emotional support and practical assistance for both children in the hospital and assisting aging adults with disabilities in Shanti.
 
 
               Compassion for our elderly with dementia is a value that is essential in society, so I am incredibly interested in researching and assisting with projects that enhance their quality of life. This is one of many reasons I believe in and value the research at the UCSF Memory and Aging Center and why I’m 
               excited about the work that I am doing as a member of the Decision lab, specifically on the [Genes, Brains and Decisions](/projects/index.html#gbd) Project. The insightful knowledge, experience, and abilities I will learn while working at UCSF’s world-class facility will better prepare me for my future as a physician and researcher.

  description:  I am a recent UC Berkeley graduate who majored in Psychology and minored in Public Policy.
  
  
                At Berkeley, I was a psychology peer advisor, marketing research intern, research assistant, and library circulation assistant. 
                These positions allowed me to meet and assist many people from diverse backgrounds, and I’m excited to continue this practice at the Decision Lab and UCSF Memory and Aging Center.
                
                
                My research interest sparked when I became a research assistant at the Berkeley Social Interaction Lab, where I researched awe and psychophysiology. 
                I loved working with participants, brainstorming new techniques, and analyzing the results. My time in this lab has taught me valuable lifelong skills and has reiterated that I want to impact and help others through research.
                
                
                After taking coursework in Clinical Psychology and Neuropsychology, I was eager to learn more about mental and aging disorders, which ultimately led me to the Decision Lab.
                Studying case studies of patients with dementia emphasized how much is still unknown. The complexity and debilitating effects of aging disorders have motivated me to work with this clinical population. 
                I am grateful to be a part of the Decision Lab, where I have the opportunity to discover unanswered questions about dementia and fundamentally improve care for patients from all backgrounds.

  description:  I first obtained my BA in psychology (Aristotle University of Thessaloniki, Greece). As a bachelor thesis student, I was introduced to the fascinating world of research by undertaking a behavioral study probing the association between cheating, creativity and moral reasoning. The question which psychological mechanisms tilt our moral compass sparked my interest. 
                However, pieces were definitely missing from understanding such a perplex topic in depth. 
                
                
                My MS in Neural and Behavioural Sciences (University of Tubingen, Germany) provided a bigger piece to the puzzle by giving me the opportunity to work out interdisciplinary questions such as how cognitive enhancers affect cheating upon monetary payoff (Oxford University, UK) and how arousal mediates different contexts of lying (Max Planck Institute for Research on Collective Goods, Germany).
                
                
                Now, being part of the Decision Lab at the Memory and Aging Center, I am thrilled to have the opportunity to add another, major piece, dementia. In other words, investigating conditions characterized notably by impairment of memory and judgment.
                In the lab, I am responsible for fMRI task design, data collection and analysis for the [Decision-Making in Alzheimer's and Related Dementias](/projects/index.html#dma) and the [Online Studies of Decision-Making in Healthy Aging](/projects/index.html#agingcog) projects. 
                Some questions I am eager to examine is how moral reasoning, dishonest behavior and overall value based decision making processes are altered in different types of dementia, including corresponding brain areas.


                In my free time I enjoy dancing, hiking and camping. When I experience a rush of adrenaline I am most likely trying to surf.

  description:  As an undergraduate, I attended UC Berkeley, where I developed a fascination for the brain and behavior, prompting me to pursue a degree in neurobiology. At Berkeley, I studied in the lab of Dr. Linda Wilbrecht where I completed an honors thesis investigating adolescent exploration, risk-taking, and reward-seeking behaviors and their neurophysiological correlates. 
                During this time, I developed a passion for research, particularly reward processing and decision making, and how the dysfunction of these processes is relevant to disease and addiction.


                Experiences outside of academics have been instrumental in helping to refine my interests. For example, I work as a crisis counselor, assisting folks in getting through challenging moments in their lives. I also volunteered at the Alzheimer’s Services of the East Bay. I found interacting with and working to improve the quality of life for older individuals of all backgrounds to 
                be critical and fulfilling, and I resolved to fuse this meaningful work with my passion for research. I became particularly interested in studying dementia, as this topic is personal to me, and there is still so much to understand about different dementias.


                I am extremely excited to be working as a clinical research coordinator in both the Decision Lab and the lab of Dr. David Perry. The research conducted by these groups integrates my interests in decision making, reward processing, and neurodegenerative disease and allows me to contribute to research that will improve the diagnostic accuracy of dementia and allow for effective 
                treatment. I look forward to learning more about this complex disease and hope our work can help patients and their loved ones to cope with its often debilitating effects.  


                In my spare time, I enjoy surfing, playing basketball, playing soccer, running and music.
