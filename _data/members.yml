  description: 'I see myself as having three main jobs, which (I hope) inform one another.
              I am a **behavioral neurologist**, and my clinical practice focuses on 
              Alzheimer's disease, frontotemporal dementia, and other cognitive disorders of 
              aging. I am also a **cognitive neuroscientist**, applying observations from 
              clinic to investigate why my patients are prone to bad decisions. Third, I am 
              a **neuroethicist**, working alongside other clinicians, researchers, and policymakers
              to address the ethical and social implications of changes in decision-making due 
              to altered brain function. 

              
              I studied philosophy as an undergraduate at UC Berkeley. During medical school 
              here at UCSF, I took a leave to do a 
              PhD in philosophy at NYU, where I studied with Thomas Nagel and Derek Parfit. 
              After residency training in neurology back at UCSF, I did a combined fellowship in 
              cognitive neuroscience and neuroimaging with [Mark D'Esposito](https://despolab.berkeley.edu){:target="\_blank"} 
              at UC Berkeley and in behavioral neurology here at the [UCSF Memory and Aging Center](http://memory.ucsf.edu){:target="\_blank"}.
              
              
              Alongside my clinical and research work, I am Associate Director of 
              the [UCSF/UC Hastings Consortium on Law, Science and Health Policy](http://www.ucconsortium.org){:target="\_blank"}, 
              and am Co-Chair of the UCSF Department of Neurology [Diversity Committee](https://neurology.ucsf.edu/diversity){:target="\_blank"}. 
              I am a member of the UCSF Medical Center Ethics Committee, the [Neuroethics Division](https://www.braininitiative.nih.gov/about/neuroethics.htm){:target="\_blank"} 
              of the National Institutes of Health BRAIN (Brain Research through Advancing Innovative Neurotechnologies) 
              Multi-Council Working Group, and the American Academy of 
              Neurology's [Ethics, Law and Humanities Committee](https://www.aan.com/conferences-community/member-engagement/Learn-About-AAN-Committees/ethics-law-and-humanities-committee/){:target="\_blank"}. '

  description: I received a B.Sc. in Communication Studies from the University of Applied Sciences 
                Zürich and an M.Phil in Sociology from Cambridge University. 
                I then went on to complete my PhD at the Cambridge Department of Sociology, where 
                I remain an Affiliated Researcher. During my doctoral studies, I was also a student 
                supervisor for the Social Context of Health and Illness seminar at the Cambridge Department 
                of Biology, where I instructed undergraduate students for the pre-clinical course within 
                the Medical and Veterinary Sciences Tripos. My PhD dissertation is titled ‘Lest We Forget 
                - Dementia Care and Community’. Based on ethnographic fieldwork in Germany’s first Dementia 
                Village, I demonstrate the local dynamics and practices by which people with dementia and 
                their care takers are reciprocally constituted. During my ethnographic fieldwork, I held 
                a Research Fellowship at the Amsterdam Institute for Social Science Research and was a 
                visiting member of the Long-term Care and Dementia group at the Centre for Social Science 
                and Global Health at the University of Amsterdam.
                
                
                I am particularly interested in how medical knowledge and care practices are interpreted 
                differently in distinct cultural settings. Beyond these specific research domains, I am 
                also interested in the sociology of health and illness, comparative ethnographic research, 
                and qualitative research methodologies.

  description: Ali, a clinical research coordinator working for Dr. Winston Chiong, currently oversees 
              the coordination of a number of studies which center around decision-making in the aging brain, 
              with a particular focus on how brain structures involved in financial and medical decisions are 
              influenced by aging and disease, and on the ethical and policy implications of these changes. 
              Ali attended University of California, Berkeley where he studied molecular toxicology and 
              nutritional sciences.  As an undergraduate, Ali spent time conducting research on substance use, 
              healthcare delivery modes and drug overdoses before making the transition to neuroscience. 
              
              
              As a San Francisco native, Ali enjoys anything and everything that has to do with the city 
              and the broader bay area. In his free time, he enjoys doing mixed martial arts, rock climbing, 
              hiking, playing sports, fantasy sports and photography.
