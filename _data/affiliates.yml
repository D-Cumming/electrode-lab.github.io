  description: I'm an undergraduate student at UC Berkeley pursuing a B.A. in Integrative Biology with the ultimate goal 
               of becoming a physician. At Berkeley, I served as a reading mentor at an under-resourced elementary school
               in Oakland through B.U.I.L.D., and am engaged in our Labor Coach Program and the Biology Scholars Program. 
               Outside of school, I volunteer as a crisis text counselor with Crisis Text Line, in which I support texters
               during their most difficult moments and empower them to make their own plans for safety. 
               

               My first introduction through research was in a psychology lab through the Stanford R.I.S.E. Program. It was
               there that I saw how research could impact the lives of individuals like myself, how its specificity and 
               thoughtfulness could intervene on and validate problems whose importance may not have been emphasized in the past.
               Having seen how dementia has affected my grandmother and the apparent cultural challenges of coping with illness, 
               the research being done at the UCSF Memory and Aging Center are personal to me. I'm excited to work with both the 
               [Program Project Grant](https://memory.ucsf.edu/research-trials/research/frontotemporal-dementia-genes-images-and-emotions){:target="\_blank"} and the Decision Lab to work towards real change and discovery in the field. In doing so, 
               I'm confident that these experiences will help me become a compassionate physician and researcher in the future. 
               

               In my free time, I love to play and create music on the piano, make coffee, and read.
