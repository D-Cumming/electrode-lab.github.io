  description: I received a bachelor’s degree in psychology at Gonzaga University and then completed a master’s degree
               program in experimental psychology at the College of William and Mary. I went on to earn a doctorate in 
               Clinical Psychology at the University of Georgia, with emphases in the neuropsychology and neuroscience 
               of aging. I am currently a postdoctoral fellow in neuropsychology within the Memory and Aging Center at
               the University of California at San Francisco (UCSF) under the mentorship of Dr. Joel Kramer.


               My program of research is broadly focused on brain aging, with specific interests in (1) identifying early 
               detection strategies for unhealthy cognitive aging and neurodegenerative diseases and (2) better understanding 
               factors that contribute to resilience against age-related cognitive decline and dementia. I also have a 
               background in studying changes in decision-making that occur in typical aging and early stages of age-related 
               neurodegenerative conditions, such as Alzheimer’s. I am excited to have the opportunity to extend this work 
               in Dr. Winston Chiong’s Decision Lab at UCSF.


               In my free time, I enjoy hiking, camping, and more generally enjoying the outdoors. Playing basketball and 
               reading novels are also high on my list of favorite pastimes.

  description: I am an undergraduate student enrolled in a four-year BSN program with a minor in gerontology at the
               University of San Francisco. Through my experiences in both hospital and clinic-settings, I have been 
               fortunate enough to interact with individuals of various walks of life. It is because of these relationships 
               that I have learned the importance of being an earnest advocate for older adults and raising awareness about 
               the diseases of aging within the larger community.
               
               
               Currently, I volunteer at Mabuhay Health Center, a student-run clinic that provides health-related services to
               residents, mainly of Filipino-American descent, living in the South of Market district in San Francisco. As a 
               second generation Filipino-American, I hope to be part of the effort in increasing diversity and inclusion within
               healthcare.
               
               
               My interest in research sparked when I began to explore nursing informatics as a possible career path. I was 
               intrigued by how informatics nurses are able to analyze trends and bring innovative, advanced systems to life
               through the use of data found from research. At the Decision Lab and UCSF’s Memory and Aging Center, I am able
               to explore my professional interests and serve a rapidly growing community of people in need by engaging in the
               studies of dementia and aging.
               
               
               In my free time, I enjoy eating good food and rollerblading to stay active. I also love watching films and listening
               to K-pop, specifically Blackpink!

  description: I'm an undergraduate student at UC Berkeley pursuing a B.A. in Integrative Biology with the ultimate goal 
               of becoming a physician. At Berkeley, I served as a reading mentor at an under-resourced elementary school
               in Oakland through B.U.I.L.D., and am engaged in our Labor Coach Program and the Biology Scholars Program. 
               Outside of school, I volunteer as a crisis text counselor with Crisis Text Line, in which I support texters
               during their most difficult moments and empower them to make their own plans for safety. 
               

               My first introduction through research was in a psychology lab through the Stanford R.I.S.E. Program. It was
               there that I saw how research could impact the lives of individuals like myself, how its specificity and 
               thoughtfulness could intervene on and validate problems whose importance may not have been emphasized in the past.
               Having seen how dementia has affected my grandmother and the apparent cultural challenges of coping with illness, 
               the research being done at the UCSF Memory and Aging Center are personal to me. I'm excited to work with both the 
               [Program Project Grant](https://memory.ucsf.edu/research-trials/research/frontotemporal-dementia-genes-images-and-emotions){:target="\_blank"} and the Decision Lab to work towards real change and discovery in the field. In doing so, 
               I'm confident that these experiences will help me become a compassionate physician and researcher in the future. 
               

               In my free time, I love to play and create music on the piano, make coffee, and read.
