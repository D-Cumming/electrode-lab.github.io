  description: I received a bachelor’s degree in psychology at Gonzaga University and then completed a master’s degree
               program in experimental psychology at the College of William and Mary. I went on to earn a doctorate in 
               Clinical Psychology at the University of Georgia, with emphases in the neuropsychology and neuroscience 
               of aging. I am currently a postdoctoral fellow in neuropsychology within the Memory and Aging Center at
               the University of California at San Francisco (UCSF) under the mentorship of Dr. Joel Kramer.


               My program of research is broadly focused on brain aging, with specific interests in identifying early 
               detection strategies for unhealthy cognitive aging and neurodegenerative diseases and better understanding 
               factors that contribute to resilience against age-related cognitive decline and dementia. I also have a 
               background in studying changes in decision-making that occur in typical aging and early stages of age-related 
               neurodegenerative conditions, such as Alzheimer’s. I am excited to have the opportunity to extend this work 
               in Dr. Winston Chiong’s Decision Lab at UCSF.


               In my free time, I enjoy hiking, camping, and more generally enjoying the outdoors. Playing basketball and 
               reading novels are also high on my list of favorite pastimes.
