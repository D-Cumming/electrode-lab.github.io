  description: I'm a neuroscientist and postdoctoral scholar in the UCSF 
              Movement Disorders and Neuromodulation Center studying motivation 
              in Parkinson's disease with Drs. Simon Little and Phil Starr and 
              neuroethics here in the Decision Lab. 


               In the Little and Starr Labs, our group aims to treat motor and 
               nonmotor (e.g., sleep, cognition, emotion) deficits in patients 
               with Parkinson's disease using neurosurgically implanted deep 
               brain stimulation (DBS) devices. My main research project focuses 
               on understanding apathy and impulsivity symptoms in these 
               patients by (1) measuring goal-directed and habitual decision 
               making with computational reinforcement learning models; 
               (2) mapping these cognitive processes to neural activity using 
               chronic invasive brain recordings; and (3) modulating these 
               neural circuits using dopaminergic medications and DBS. 


               In the Decision Lab, I'm studying bioethics to better understand 
               the ethical, legal, and social implications of neurotechnology. 
               For example, if brain stimulation can alter motivation or other 
               aspects of one's personality and identity, how should we deploy 
               and regulate these treatments? I hope that combining neuroethics 
               with my basic and clinical neuroscience research will help inform 
               guidelines for the responsible use of neurotechnology. 


               I graduated in 2012 from Hendrix College with a BA in 
               Neuroscience before spending two years as a postbaccalaureate 
               researcher at the National Institute of Mental Health working on 
               functional MRI methods. In 2021, I graduated from UC Berkeley 
               with a PhD in Neuroscience in which I studied cognitive control 
               using intracranial brain recordings from epilepsy patients. 
               Outside of the lab, I enjoy playing ultimate frisbee, hiking, 
               kayaking, and camping.

  description: I'm a cognitive neuroscientist and postdoctoral scholar in the 
               lab of Dr. Edward Chang, situated within the department of 
               Neurological Surgery and the Center for Integrative Neuroscience 
               at UCSF. I have a B.A. in Physics with a Music minor from UC 
               Berkeley, and I completed my PhD in Neuroscience from the 
               University of Sydney. My basic research interests are in 
               understanding the neural circuitry underlying our experience of 
               music. To  investigate this, I use a combination of intracranial 
               and non-invasive approaches to measure human brain activity 
               during music listening. I then apply computational modeling 
               techniques to this activity to characterize how neurons encode 
               relevant perceptual, cognitive, and emotional parameters of 
               music, and the neural specializations that exist for music versus 
               other auditory domains such as speech.
               
               
               I'm also studying neuroethics with Dr. Winston Chiong in the 
               Decision Lab at UCSF to better understand the broader societal 
               implications of neuroscientific research. I'm interested in 
               determining how research translates into public understanding and 
               how to promote increased collaboration between neuroscientists, 
               neuroethicists, and the public to effectively comprehend and 
               communicate the risks and benefits associated with advances in 
               our understanding of the human brain.
               
               Outside of work, I play and consume music, I ride my bike in the 
               East Bay hills, and I'm constantly on the lookout for the best 
               swimming spot in the Bay or Pacific Ocean.

  description: I am an epilepsy fellow at UCSF with additional training in 
               medical ethics and humanities. I completed an ethics fellowship 
               at Stanford University, where I also earned my MD. Before coming 
               to San Francisco, I was a neurology resident at the University of 
               Pennsylvania.
               
               
               I have a strong clinical interest in surgical epilepsy, 
               specifically in novel neuromodulatory devices like RNS. In the 
               Decision Lab, I study the ethical, social, and legal implications 
               of these devices on clinical care and research. I am particularly 
               interested in patient-physician communication, patient and caregiver 
               decision-making, and evolving paradigms for informed consent.
