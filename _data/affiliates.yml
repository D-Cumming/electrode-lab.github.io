  description: As a research and compliance analyst at the UCSF Institutional Review Board and concurrent graduate student at Columbia in Bioethics,
               my mission is to protect the rights and welfare of human participants. My perspective merges “how to” with “should we” -- through the translation
               of regulatory science and embodiment of the Belmont Principles. Within the UCSF IRB, my work is aimed at understanding and providing guidance on
               the policies that influence clinical research locally, nationally, and internationally. 
               

               I hold an interdisciplinary degree in Biology, Psychology, and Sociology from San Diego State University, where my thesis analyzed the
               neurobiological effects of the practice of yoga. This fusion of fascination within neurobiology, technology, and regulatory expertise 
               inspired my current research work in the ethical challenges of neurotechnologies. 


               Currently, I am on the leadership team of the Science Policy Group at UCSF, a member of the Public Responsibility in Medicine and Research (PRIM&R),
               National Science Policy Network (NSPN), International Neuroethics Society (INS), and California Life Science Association (CLSA).


               In my free time I like to travel, practice yoga, read, and visit modern art museums.

  description: I'm an undergraduate student at UC Berkeley pursuing a B.A. in Integrative Biology with the ultimate goal 
               of becoming a physician. At Berkeley, I served as a reading mentor at an under-resourced elementary school
               in Oakland through B.U.I.L.D., and am engaged in our Labor Coach Program and the Biology Scholars Program. 
               Outside of school, I volunteer as a crisis text counselor with Crisis Text Line, in which I support texters
               during their most difficult moments and empower them to make their own plans for safety. 
               

               My first introduction through research was in a psychology lab through the Stanford R.I.S.E. Program. It was
               there that I saw how research could impact the lives of individuals like myself, how its specificity and 
               thoughtfulness could intervene on and validate problems whose importance may not have been emphasized in the past.
               Having seen how dementia has affected my grandmother and the apparent cultural challenges of coping with illness, 
               the research being done at the UCSF Memory and Aging Center are personal to me. I'm excited to work with both the 
               [Program Project Grant](https://memory.ucsf.edu/research-trials/research/frontotemporal-dementia-genes-images-and-emotions){:target="\_blank"} and the Decision Lab to work towards real change and discovery in the field. In doing so, 
               I'm confident that these experiences will help me become a compassionate physician and researcher in the future. 
               

               In my free time, I love to play and create music on the piano, make coffee, and read.
