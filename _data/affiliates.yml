  description: I’m a neuroscientist and postdoctoral scholar in the UCSF Movement Disorders and Neuromodulation Center studying motivation in Parkinson’s disease with Drs. Simon Little and Phil Starr and neuroethics here in the Decision Lab. 


               In the Little and Starr Labs, our group aims to treat motor and nonmotor (e.g., sleep, cognition, emotion) deficits in patients with Parkinson’s disease using neurosurgically implanted deep brain stimulation (DBS) devices. 
               My main research project focuses on understanding apathy and impulsivity symptoms in these patients by (1) measuring goal-directed and habitual decision making with computational reinforcement learning models; 
               (2) mapping these cognitive processes to neural activity using chronic invasive brain recordings; and (3) modulating these neural circuits using dopaminergic medications and DBS. 


               In the Decision Lab, I’m studying bioethics to better understand the ethical, legal, and social implications of neurotechnology. For example, if brain stimulation can alter motivation or other aspects of one’s personality and identity,
               how should we deploy and regulate these treatments? I hope that combining neuroethics with my basic and clinical neuroscience research will help inform guidelines for the responsible use of neurotechnology. 


               I graduated in 2012 from Hendrix College with a BA in Neuroscience before spending two years as a postbaccalaureate researcher at the National Institute of Mental Health working on functional MRI methods.
               In 2021, I graduated from UC Berkeley with a PhD in Neuroscience in which I studied cognitive control using intracranial brain recordings from epilepsy patients. Outside of the lab, I enjoy playing ultimate frisbee, hiking, kayaking, and camping.

  description: As a research and compliance analyst at the UCSF Institutional Review Board and concurrent graduate student at Columbia in Bioethics,
               my mission is to protect the rights and welfare of human participants. My perspective merges “how to” with “should we” -- through the translation
               of regulatory science and embodiment of the Belmont Principles. Within the UCSF IRB, my work is aimed at understanding and providing guidance on
               the policies that influence clinical research locally, nationally, and internationally. 
               

               I hold an interdisciplinary degree in Biology, Psychology, and Sociology from San Diego State University, where my thesis analyzed the
               neurobiological effects of the practice of yoga. This fusion of fascination within neurobiology, technology, and regulatory expertise 
               inspired my current research work in the ethical challenges of neurotechnologies. 


               Currently, I am on the leadership team of the Science Policy Group at UCSF, a member of the Public Responsibility in Medicine and Research (PRIM&R),
               National Science Policy Network (NSPN), International Neuroethics Society (INS), and California Life Science Association (CLSA).


               In my free time I like to travel, practice yoga, read, and visit modern art museums.

  description: I'm an undergraduate student at UC Berkeley pursuing a B.A. in Integrative Biology with the ultimate goal 
               of becoming a physician. At Berkeley, I served as a reading mentor at an under-resourced elementary school
               in Oakland through B.U.I.L.D., and am engaged in our Labor Coach Program and the Biology Scholars Program. 
               Outside of school, I volunteer as a crisis text counselor with Crisis Text Line, in which I support texters
               during their most difficult moments and empower them to make their own plans for safety. 
               

               My first introduction through research was in a psychology lab through the Stanford R.I.S.E. Program. It was
               there that I saw how research could impact the lives of individuals like myself, how its specificity and 
               thoughtfulness could intervene on and validate problems whose importance may not have been emphasized in the past.
               Having seen how dementia has affected my grandmother and the apparent cultural challenges of coping with illness, 
               the research being done at the UCSF Memory and Aging Center are personal to me. I'm excited to work with both the 
               [Program Project Grant](https://memory.ucsf.edu/research-trials/research/frontotemporal-dementia-genes-images-and-emotions){:target="\_blank"} and the Decision Lab to work towards real change and discovery in the field. In doing so, 
               I'm confident that these experiences will help me become a compassionate physician and researcher in the future. 
               

               In my free time, I love to play and create music on the piano, make coffee, and read.
