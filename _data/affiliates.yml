  description: I am a college student transitioning from a former career as a Ballet dancer to a field of medicine, 
               science, and groundbreaking clinical research. As an undergraduate student in the Liberal Education for 
               Arts Professionals program at Saint Mary’s College of California, I am also earning an Associate’s degree 
               in the field of Biological Sciences at Canada College. When focusing on my artistry as a ballerina traveling 
               around the world to almost thirty different countries, I was awarded the Princess Grace Award, a Congressional 
               Black Caucus Foundation’s Performing Arts Medal, and the Chris Hellman Award among other newspaper and magazine
               features. While I appreciate and value my time in the dance world, I always knew that one day I would like to 
               go into medicine. As a college student, I’ve been inducted into Phi Theta Kappa Honor Society, Alpha Gamma 
               Sigma Honor Society, and made the Dean’s List of Honor Students. 


               I discovered my passion for research during my time as an NIH researcher in the Bridges to Baccalaureate Program 
               through SF State University, where I acquired laboratory skills and presented on various research projects. When 
               I am not doing schoolwork or studying for the MCAT, much of my time is spent volunteering at the UCSF Benioff 
               Children’s Hospital and at Shanti Project, where I was grateful to be named the Spotlight Volunteer in Shanti’s 
               Spring 2019 Newsletter. I am thrilled to provide emotional support and practical assistance for both children in
               the hospital and for people in a program specialized in helping aging adults with disabilities.
 
 
               Compassion for our elderly with dementia is a value that is essential in society, so I am incredibly interested 
               in researching and assisting with projects that enhance their quality of life. This is one of many reasons why 
               I believe in the research being conducted at the UCSF Memory and Aging Center and why I am excited about the work
               that I am doing as a member of the [Program Project Grant](https://memory.ucsf.edu/research-trials/research/frontotemporal-dementia-genes-images-and-emotions){:target="\_blank"} and the Decision lab. The insightful knowledge, experience,
               and abilities I will learn while working at UCSF’s world-class facility will better prepare me for my future as a 
               physician and researcher. 
 
 
               In my spare time, I enjoy swimming, hiking, reading, and Pilates.

  description: I received a bachelor’s degree in psychology at Gonzaga University and then completed a master’s degree
               program in experimental psychology at the College of William and Mary. I went on to earn a doctorate in 
               Clinical Psychology at the University of Georgia, with emphases in the neuropsychology and neuroscience 
               of aging. I am currently a postdoctoral fellow in neuropsychology within the Memory and Aging Center at
               the University of California at San Francisco (UCSF) under the mentorship of Dr. Joel Kramer.


               My program of research is broadly focused on brain aging, with specific interests in (1) identifying early 
               detection strategies for unhealthy cognitive aging and neurodegenerative diseases and (2) better understanding 
               factors that contribute to resilience against age-related cognitive decline and dementia. I also have a 
               background in studying changes in decision-making that occur in typical aging and early stages of age-related 
               neurodegenerative conditions, such as Alzheimer’s. I am excited to have the opportunity to extend this work 
               in Dr. Winston Chiong’s Decision Lab at UCSF.


               In my free time, I enjoy hiking, camping, and more generally enjoying the outdoors. Playing basketball and 
               reading novels are also high on my list of favorite pastimes.
