Winston Chiong led a journal club discussion about a recent *Nature* [comment](https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-019-01168-9){:target="_blank"} 
written by Nita Farahany, Henry Greely, and Charles Giattino in response to a Yale [study](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-019-1099-1){:target="_blank"},  
called BrainEx, in which investigators successfully restored and preserved some cellular functions, from microcirculation 
to spontaneous synaptic activity, in whole pig brains that were perfused four hours after death.
