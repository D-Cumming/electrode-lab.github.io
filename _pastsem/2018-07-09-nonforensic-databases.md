In April 2018 a DNA ancestry registry was used to identify the Golden State Killer â€“ since then additional reports of police using DNA and family trees to solve cold cases (NYT Article). During this upcoming NeuroEthics meeting we will discuss the legal and ethical issues on the topic. The discussion will include an examination of the underlying ethical concerns, a description of how the data is being used and the rigor of the science underlying the techniques, and the role of genetic counseling.
