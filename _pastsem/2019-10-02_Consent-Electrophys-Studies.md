	During todayâ€™s seminar, Cailin Lechner presented on a collaborative project investigating dual consent in 
  human electrophysiology studies. Generally, there is a regulatory gap in consent guidelines, where regulations or policies 
  attempt to provide recommendations on how to consent yet fail to provide guidelines on which members of the study could best
  obtain consent. This may be further compounded by the complexity of studies like human electrophysiology studies because they
  require patients, who often have impaired decision-making capacity, to consent to technically complex and high-risk 
  neurosurgeries for non-therapeutic, primarily investigative purposes. As a result, the personnel responsible for going 
  through the consent processes with patients and how they do it holds great influence on the ethical practices of the studies.
  
	Using semi-structured interviews with investigators from various electrophysiology studies, the results found that dual-role 
  consent was often the method of consent for most of the studies included. In these instances, one team member, usually the 
  surgeon or the principal investigator, was responsible for detailing the complexity of the surgery while another team member,
  such as a research coordinator, would collect the consent. Ultimately, determining who would obtain consent relied on several
  ethical themes, including the need to provide expert knowledge, while also preserving the aspect of voluntariness, the 
  potential for coercion that investigators or clinicians may have on patients if the role of the consenter influenced 
  responses about involvement, and which team members were best qualified to discuss the risks that the surgery and subsequent 
  involvement in the research study provided (such as its investigative, non-therapeutic nature, post-trial obligations, etc.).
  
	Our discussion included centered around navigating between the values of expertise and knowledge versus the voluntariness 
  in the consent process. We wondered if a non-physician team member could provide enough expertise to ensure that the patient 
  was knowledgeable about his or her involvement to preserve the voluntariness of consent without compromising the quality of
  the discussion. We then wondered if IRB guidelines could help provide better consent processes if boards were better aware 
  of the details of the experiment and what degree of understanding would be required in order to have consent. Finally, the 
  group also acknowledged the need for additional inquiries on whether or not patients believed if they were adequately 
  informed or if they liked or would have preferred being consented by certain team members, although we also recognized the 
  influence that research outcomes may have on these types of post-hoc responses.
